[ i ] THE SPEAR OF FRANCESCO ALFIERI MASTER OF ARMS Of the Most Illustrious Academy of Padua.

[2] (P35.S0)
[ iii ] MOST ILLUSTRIOUS LORD Sir.

[3] (P35.S1)
and Master Colendiss.

[4] (P35.S2)
The acquisition made by the Most Illustrious House of the Dominion of Ortemburgh, the most noble County of the Empire in Carinthia, has brought me, as your most devoted servant, such joy that, unable to contain it within my breast, I have been compelled to share it with the world through this present Book, which I dedicate as a living testament of my infinite obligations to the immortality of your Most Illustrious name. The gift is small and greatly disproportionate to the greatness of your merits, but my talents are weak in comparison; however, they will never lack value when they are accompanied by the authority of your favor. I dedicate this to Your Serenity.

[5] (P35.S3)
Most Illustrious, my treatise on the Banner was pleased to find favor with you, for it could not recognize in it anything singular other than my reverence; the spirit that in obedience is always of one tenor has placed me in hope that this brief treatise on the Pike may likewise be to your liking. The labors of the mind must, by every right, be offered to Your Serenity.

[6] (P35.S4)
Illustrious.

[7] (P35.S5)
That for the sublime virtues by which it shines all adorned will, in every time, become greater than any example. What is that chivalric exercise in which it does not prevail?

[8] (P35.S6)
What is that science which can, both in arms and in civil life, make others respectable, that does not deserve to be admired in itself?

[9] (P35.S7)
It is not my intention to dwell on its prerogatives, which do not weigh upon my shoulders; I speak with the tongue of all, which is moved solely by the truth; May Your Serenity enjoy.

[10] (P35.S8)
Most Illustrious.

[11] (P35.S9)
With all due respect, the possession of so many goods, may it be my glory to be counted among those who will forever depend on his commands; And to Your Excellency.

[12] (P35.S10)
Illustrious.

[13] (P35.S11)
I bow reverently.

[14] (P35.S12)
Of Padua the 28th.

[16] (P35.S14)
Of Your Serenity.

Most Illustrious and Most Humble Servant Francesco Alfieri.

[18] (P36.S0)
[ 03 ] TO THE READER.

[19] (P36.S1)
Not long ago, you saw my Fencing come out in print; it was the first sample of my labors, the Banner, and now I add the Pike. The book is not large, yet it is complete; brevity is pleasing today, especially if it does not lack the necessary parts that would make the work defective. I have condensed the entire art, or at least the true foundations of the art, into a few Figures, so that sharp and practiced minds may find various inventions that are not present here. However, those who truly grasp what I have demonstrated will know that these are superfluous or without difficulty.

[20] (P36.S2)
My aim has always been to lead the Student to perfection through free methods, which are approved by the good, and not to confuse them with whims and fantasies, which only serve to waste time: I would like to satisfy the desires of all, and if the style or the subject are not worthy of doing so, I must be all the more pitied because the intention I have had to benefit the public has made me wish for more than I can accomplish.

[21] (P37.S0)
[ 05 ] ON THE SPEAR OF FRANCESCO FERº ALFIERI.

[22] (P37.S1)
CAP.

[23] (P37.S2)
I. Man is of such nature that he is hardly ever content. To remove the occasions for disputes, lands were divided, and dominions were introduced; each began to recognize his own, and almost at the same time, either to preserve it or to seize that of his neighbor, wars arose. And through wars, arms were found, among which one of the first was the Pike. All things, in their beginnings, are rough and gradually become perfected; thus the Pike, initially used without that polish to which it has been reduced, before iron was discovered, had its shafts armed with sharp stones, bones, and similar materials suitable for wounding, and in this manner they fought. But once iron was discovered, it was placed in one and by many peoples at both ends in such a form that it was believed to be more piercing and stronger to offend. Its length and thickness varied according to how much or how little robust were the nations that made use of it.

[24] (P37.S3)
The Syrians were the first, according to the opinion of many esteemed authors, to bring them into war, having in this province begun the kingdoms and lordships: The Hebrews, in whom the military flourished because the Great Prophet Moses learned it from God, organized their armed squads with pikes, as is clearly seen in various places of Scripture, and the battles they fought in Palestine against the peoples condemned by Divine justice to be defeated by the chosen people were fought by armies that waged war with spears; the Persians also used them and became accustomed to handling them well, since Cyrus, the greatest captain, introduced the art of military discipline and training; After the Persians, and as the glory of arms flourished in Greece, they too held it in high regard, as seen in the Lives of Palamedes, Philopoemen, Miltiades, Themistocles, and other great warriors of Athens, Sparta, and Thebes: and Philip of Macedon, who learned from Lysidias the skill of arms, formed his Phalanx armed with pikes, with which Alexander the Great, his son, subdued almost the whole world; the Republic of Rome, which excelled in all virtues as well as in the power of all that the earth possessed, had its spearmen, and with these arms, the name of their legions became terrible.

[25] (P37.S4)
And to bring myself closer to our times, neglecting to recall Uguccione dalla Faggiola, and particularly the famous Castruccio Castracani, who reinstated the military discipline that had been neglected for a long time, the Swiss will always be remembered for their immortal pikes, having been, due to their skill in wielding them, the arbiters of victories in Italy. Each one knows to what heights they rose when the wars for the state of Milan grew fierce, of which, Lodovico il Moro was a part, alongside Lodovico XII.

[26] (P37.S5)
King of France, and Maximilian his Son, were stripped of them by Francesco the First, for the Emperor was doing all he could to restore the Sforzas—who in the duchy followed the celebrated feats of arms at Novara, at the Bicocca, and in other places, which will always be eternal witnesses of the valor of that free Nation of the Thirteen Cantons, of which there is no doubt regarding the antiquity, nobility, and marvelous effects of the Pike.

[27] (P37.S6)
And we certify also that such an art must be judged for every reason, and that those who, wishing to follow the fortune of war, will strive with all their might to learn it, shall always be worthy of praise.

[28] (P38.S0)
[ 09 ] ON THE USE OF THE PIKE.

[29] (P38.S1)
CAP.

[30] (P38.S2)
II.

[31] (P38.S3)
To serve well with the Pike, it is essential to know its length and quality. As for the length, the ordinary measure is nine arms; regarding the quality, it should be made of smooth Ash wood, and the timber must be well seasoned. In ancient times, it was wielded without defensive arms to allow for greater agility in handling it, and because men had not yet become so ingenious in offense. Thus, it only struck from afar, and as the enemy approached, one could no longer resist its force, placing all hope solely in the spear. Through experience, it has been recognized that used in this manner, it was not of much consequence; therefore, the soldier has been provided with a somewhat shorter and broader sword to make it swifter and easier to cut, along with a dagger, a weapon of great value in close quarters. And because the pikemen serve to form the body of the battle and withstand the charge and impact of horses, so that they are not routed by them, they are equipped with breastplates, arm guards, gauntlets, gorgets, and helmets; thus, being well-armed, they can easily render the enemy's attempts and efforts futile, especially as the armor extends from the flanks of the battle, which are lines of musketeers that can be covered by the Pikes. Therefore, it is employed with a specific size proportionate to the stature and strength of all men, accompanied by their defensive arms, which, without hindering the soldier, increase his confidence and prepare him for fortitude.

[32] (P39.S0)
[ 11 ] OF THE DIFFERENCE OF THE PIKE.

[33] (P39.S1)
in the play, and in war.

[34] (P39.S2)
CAP.

[35] (P39.S3)
III.

[36] (P39.S4)
For the taste of many is merely to contradict, yet some will tell me at the beautiful beginning, that the Pike with which one fights is different from the Pike with which one plays. I well know that in the field, and before the enemy, one does not think of making a display, neither of skill nor of grace, nor does one resort to other movements that serve more to delight than to wound. But may I be allowed to ask these if knowing how to handle the spear is an advantage; if having the art of thrusting with judgment without entangling or confusing them facilitates being superior, knowing the timing, knowing how to serve it, and being ready to use the spear differently, and to draw the sword are necessary parts in war. These are learned primarily in the Academies where the manners are shown, which are practiced for play; it is not possible to believe how much ornament and utility it is for a soldier to possess all that can be done with that weapon, which should be by his choice the instrument of his honors and fortunes. If one is placed in a completely new arrangement, and it is necessary to fight in a tight place, nothing could be more ridiculous or more useless; if he wishes to draw his sword, the Pike will fall from his hand; if he must turn, he will strike and offend either his line or those nearby; and finally, it will be of no good, neither for himself nor for his Captain, which does not happen to one who is practiced in the art, for he who possesses what is more difficult possesses in the same craft what is easier. Therefore, he who knows how to make the Pike fly, and without losing it, to make it glide and slide in every direction will not become entangled, nor will he give occasion with his harm to be mocked. Thus, they are different, but in play, all that is necessary in war is understood, where none make progress except those who know, for it is a saying that no one doubts doing what they have confidence in having well learned. And to acquire this understanding, one must practice diligently, and one should commend that which, to become familiar with those precepts that will lead him to his ends, sweats in the most difficult things to find delight in those that seem more pliable to his thoughts than he believes.

[37] (P40.S0)
[ 14 ] OF LIFTING THE SPEAR.

[38] (P40.S1)
CAP.

[39] (P40.S2)
IV.

[40] (P40.S3)
I come to the demonstrations and the figures, which teach much more effectively than speeches do, for seeing the postures and the manners drawn, which must be observed to imitate them, removes all doubts that could arise from the weakness of understanding.

[41] (P41.S0)
OF GRIPPING THE SPEAR FOR MARCHING.

[42] (P41.S1)
CAP.

[43] (P41.S2)
V. When wishing to march with the ensign raised, as shown in the figure of raising it, three times are necessary.

[44] (P41.S3)
The first is to raise the Pike so high that it barely surpasses the height of the head, taking with the left hand the shaft directly at the side.

[45] (P42.S0)
[ 18 ] ON MARCHING WITH THE PIKE ON ONE'S SHOULDER.

[46] (P42.S1)
CAP.

[47] (P42.S2)
VI.

[48] (P42.S3)
In carrying the Pike on the shoulder, these are the true documents; it shall be the angle without being forced, thus, neither too high nor bent to the ground, for the former tires, and the latter lacks grace. The hand must be held somewhat away from the shoulder, with the left curved at the hip, and one shall be able to turn the face and change the Pike while turning the body without any disarray.

[49] (P43.S0)
[ 20 ] OF ARMING THE PIKE, or taking guard.

[50] (P43.S1)
CAP.

[51] (P43.S2)
VII.

[52] (P43.S3)
After having shown how to raise and elevate the Pike, and how to march with it, let us come to the motion with which one strikes; to have the body well positioned, one must keep the left foot forward, take the spear in the right hand at the grip, and the other hand bends with the arm in an arc at the level of the chest, touching the elbow to support the Pike; one may also advance with a step, and while disengaging the strike, always retract the left arm to the designated place, returning to the same guard in which, both to press and to evade the enemy, one moves.

[53] (P44.S0)
[ 22 ] OF THE RAISED PIKE.

[54] (P44.S1)
to stand in order, or truly in guard, and to walk.

[55] (P44.S2)
CAP.

[56] (P44.S3)
VIII.

[57] (P44.S4)
How the Pike should be positioned in order, or in guard, is evident and without doubt from the Figure, but the walking done with it is not done with the same observation in all places. The Spaniards use a wide step, which is the custom of the ancients; the French use it much narrower, which is followed by moderns. Both can be defended as good, but the tempered step, which is neither wide nor narrow, is much more perfect of both.

[58] (P45.S0)
HOW THE CAPTAIN CARRIES THE PIKE.

[59] (P45.S1)
In order.

[60] (P45.S2)
CAP.

[61] (P45.S3)
IX.

[62] (P45.S4)
We must learn from the opposing Figure the manner that is proper for the Captain in carrying the Pike in order, and this is ordinarily practiced in two ways.

[63] (P45.S5)
In the first, it is carried on the shoulder, and it has much of the heavy.

[64] (P45.S6)
In the second, one holds the staff near the right side, and this is new, and practiced in the guard of the King of France for being useful and expedient in offense, and to show various skills by bringing the hand to the butt, and now to the tip, making the Pike slide from one hand to the other according to the disposition of the one handling it, which peculiarities gain credit and love from the soldier, and are of great utility to serve as testimony that one possesses the use of their own weapons.

[65] (P46.S0)
[ 26 ] OF THE PIKE IN PLACES where it cannot be held aloft.

[66] (P46.S1)
CAP.

[67] (P46.S2)
X. The places where arms are employed are not always of the same nature; one fights in the open fields, and sometimes in the woods, being compelled in the defense of a position to drag the Pike, the methods by which one holds it can be reduced to just two.

[68] (P46.S3)
The first is with the right hand near the tip.

[69] (P46.S4)
The second is with both seeking that the thumb is extended along the length of the shaft, which serves to operate with grace, which is the soul of all that is done in this craft. It is held so short, and at the straightness of the side, not presenting the opportunity to be in a position to offend, and needing to stay within a door, or another place to wait for others to pass, and to ask them their name, and to seize the enemy's weapons, a thought worthy of every honorable soldier, who is all the more deserving of being preferred by others, as he excels in the use of those weapons in which the hopes of progress are placed. Therefore, it is always necessary to practice and prepare in the Academies to be able to employ them promptly as the need requires, knowing how to handle them in all parts, and to draw from the art that defense which is acquired in the play.

[70] (P47.S0)
OF CARRYING THE SPEAR IN FLIGHT and turning face in the retreat.

[71] (P47.S1)
CAP.

[72] (P47.S2)
XI.

[73] (P47.S3)
The battles are uncertain; sometimes one wins, sometimes one loses, and it often happens that fleeing is a form of strength. Upon reaching this point, while standing in guard to fight, one abandons the Pike with the left hand, and holding it with the right in the usual grip, it will suffice to turn the back while keeping the arm back as seen in the drawing. If one wishes to make a head and turn the face, one turns the body, and with swiftness pulls back the right foot, and by turning the arm, lifts the Pike into the air, and as it falls, meets it with the left hand, thus coming to be in guard. These movements are capable of many embellishments, such as slides, flights, half-flights, and other devices that are characteristic of the Academies.

[74] (P48.S0)
[30] ON THE FLOW OF THE PIKE AND THE SWORD.

[75] (P48.S1)
CAP.

[76] (P48.S2)
XII.

[77] (P48.S3)
In this drawing, we see the way to slide the Pike backward until the left hand remains close to the iron. The soldier finds himself with his left side forward, and wishing to make use of his weapons without abandoning them, he turns his left hand in reverse, with which he must pass the spear over his head. In this motion, he returns to his natural position while grasping the Pike, and afterwards, he can easily reach for his sword without losing his balance, drawing it over his left arm without moving his feet. Thus, it will be easy for him to use both weapons together, enabling him to better resist and fight with the advantage of two arms. This should be clear to those who understand the importance of such skills and dedicate themselves to the military. Therefore, the wise never tire of practicing and learning, demonstrating strength and agility by throwing the Pike in various ways, allowing it to run from the tip to the butt, and deriving a thousand discoveries, all of which contribute to the perfection of this art.

[78] (P49.S0)
[ 32 ] OF THE PIKE AND THE SWORD IN BATTLE.

[79] (P49.S1)
CAP.

[80] (P49.S2)
XIII.

[81] (P49.S3)
Here is demonstrated the use of the Pike and the Sword. It is great mastery to make the Pike slide forward and backward according to need, with a weary hand, a member in itself, weak and ill-disposed, which becomes skilled only through practice. The arms are changed, and various cuts are made with the Sword, always remaining so well-formed that the arms are ready to defend and to strike, advancing and pressing the enemy as well as in retreating, they will hinder turning the face and executing whatever is proposed by judgment and necessity, while the soldier must not falter in these extremes.

[82] (P50.S0)
[ 34 ] ON LIFTING THE SPEAR FROM THE SHOULDER.

[83] (P50.S1)
with the sword held in hand.

[84] (P50.S2)
CAP.

[85] (P50.S3)
XIV.

[86] (P50.S4)
There are many inventions that show us the matter in this Chapter, such as how to turn the face to change hands, and to make it slide, to make the Pike fly, and all that which consists of the art. The present method is truly direct, swift, and more secure than all; the soldier finds himself in the manner depicted in the drawing. When he wishes to lift the spear, he must raise the elbow to the level of the shoulder, and firmly set it above, immediately placing the hand under the neck, and he will grip it by turning the palm, extending it along the arm, and gracefully letting the spear fall towards the ground.

[87] (P51.S0)
[ 36 ] OF PUTTING THE SWORD IN THE SHEATH.

[88] (P51.S1)
without abandoning the Pike.

[89] (P51.S2)
CAP.

[90] (P51.S3)
XV.

[91] (P51.S4)
All the masters strive to enhance the things discovered, or to perfect them; we have demonstrated the progress of the art, without many subtle refinements, which are difficult to represent without risking being lengthy, and which are only learned under the discipline of those who teach it. We are in the final lesson, and this is in itself very clear, although it has its peculiarities, and for several reasons it is not very common. I know that in any place, whoever discovers the Pike can, without abandoning it, place the Sword in the scabbard; nevertheless, having it raised and resting on the right shoulder while keeping the hilt at the tip of the foot, as the figure presents, remaining firm and steady, is a manner of great grace and great ease. It is free after taking the spear according to intention and circumstances, and with the sword at the side, one can assume their ordinary step, with a gravity that does not seem affected, making a pause with ease.
