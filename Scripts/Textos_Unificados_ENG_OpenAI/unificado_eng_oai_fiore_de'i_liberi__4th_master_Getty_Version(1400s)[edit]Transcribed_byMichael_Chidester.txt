[1] (P164.S0)
[ 14v-a ] ¶ The fourth Master is he who plays with this grip.

[2] (P164.S1)
As similar as this, my school will offend many.

[3] (P164.S2)
And if I turn to the right side, I do not leave you the arm.

[4] (P164.S3)
I thrust the dagger at you and will make you feel its sting.

[5] (P166.S0)
[ 14v-b ] ¶ This is a high binding that closes well  
I can take the dagger from you and put you on the ground.

[6] (P166.S1)
I can still dislocate your arm, if you were to grab me with your weary right hand, my opponent would be at a disadvantage, and it would be necessary for you to let go.

[7] (P167.S0)
[ 14v-c ] ¶ This is another strong upper bind.

[8] (P167.S1)
And to put you on the ground, I am quite certain,  
And to dislocate your arm or break it, whichever I wish to do.

[9] (P167.S2)
¶ The opposite of mine is. If you take it with the hand, your right will tire.

[10] (P167.S3)
Your grip will be good, and mine will have failed.

[11] (P169.S0)
[ 14v-d ] ¶ When I took the grip of my Master, my weary hand rested beneath your right elbow.

[12] (P169.S1)
And my right hand took you under the knee suddenly, so that I can bring you to the ground, and no opponent can do anything against me.

[13] (P170.S0)
[ 38r-a ] ¶ As I turn my right hand in a round motion towards your dagger, I will strike it directly near your arm that I hold.

[14] (P170.S1)
And your dagger will remain in my hand as a pledge.

[15] (P170.S2)
And then they will treat you according to what you are worthy of.

[16] (P171.S0)
If I raise this dagger near your elbow, it will surely remain in my hand to strike you.

[17] (P171.S1)
Although this play should be executed quickly, so that the contrary does not harm him.

[18] (P173.S0)
[ 38r-c ] ¶ Of the Fourth King and master, I am a counterfeiter,  
And these two plays that are before me do the opposite,  
So that in such a way I have spoiled their hands  
And their Master with a strike that I will make immediately.

[19] (P173.S1)
If they were well armed, I would surely ruin them.
