[1] (P40.S0)
[ 2a ] Here begins the book of dueling and fighting, called the Flower of Warriors, in arms and without arms, both mounted and on foot, composed by me, Fiore dei Liberi of the city of Aquileia, formerly the domain of the noble lineage of the blessed Benedict.

[2] (P41.S0)
Indeed, I now turn to the purpose of this work, lest it be that the noble art of chivalry be carelessly neglected, for it is a most excellent aid in wars or any other tumultuous affairs. I have decided to compose this book on the aforementioned art, concerning various useful matters, depicting various figures and examples, by which the knight or fighter may utilize the methods of invasions, defenses, and stratagems alike.

[3] (P42.S0)
Whoever, therefore, of noble spirit shall inspect this our work, let him cherish it as a certain treasure and keep it hidden, lest it be revealed among the rural folk, who are in no way suited to it, being dull of senses and agility, and like beasts of burden, unworthy of honor. For this reason, I consider it necessary to repel those who are unworthy and to accompany, in opposition, the kings, dukes, princes, and barons, as well as the other courtiers and others capable in duel, according to that imperial majesty, not only adorned with arms but also with other virtues.

[4] (P43.S0)
Let no one in this present volume believe falsehoods or promises not made, for by cutting through ambiguities, only what is seen and proven by love shall be described. Therefore, let us begin to expose our intention with the help of all-powerful, whose name is blessed and praised in the ages. Amen.

[5] (P44.S0)
[ 2b ] Â¶ If the act of arms delights you, friend, know that you have with you all that the poems demonstrate. Be bold and have spirit, nor let age be present. Fear should not hinder you from achieving this. In this example, a woman may be timid, but a naked man would not await the sword, seized by fear. Thus, a man, fearful as a woman, will be of no worth. Let courage and spirit fill the heart, for such courage and virtue consist in the art.
