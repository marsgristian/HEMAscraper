[1] (P214.S0)
[ 35a-a ] With my dagger, I know how to cut and then point to cover. One by one, let it come, for the play will not fail. And my scholar will demonstrate it as proof. Do it according to how it is found.

[2] (P215.S0)
[ 35a-b ] The proof here is found in the painting. You see that I can wound you if you do not pay attention.

[3] (P216.S0)
[ 35a-c ] The sword here with the dagger, I have turned you and I am spinning.

[4] (P217.S0)
[ 35a-d ] If one were to strike me with the sword at the head, I would cover myself with the quick catch. With my weary hand, I would turn him, and with the dagger, I would wound him in the back.

[5] (P218.S0)
[ 35b-a ] For you do not have me to strike in the back, this I do well, if it is without pain.

[6] (P219.S0)
[ 35b-b ] From dagger to sword is the division. The sword against the dagger has its own life, and it will show to its scholar in what manner that play can be made.

[7] (P220.S0)
[ 35b-c ] In this manner, the sword defends against the dagger. When the sword strikes you, the dagger cannot do anything to you.

[8] (P221.S0)
[ 35b-d ] This is another strange departure. The dagger against the sword is invited. The sword will make the play of the scholar, and it will show that the dagger cannot do anything.

[9] (P223.S0)
[ 36a-a ] When I strike you with the guaghina, I will hit the eye of your head, and with the sword, I will leave you no rest.
