[1] (P224.S0)
[ 20r-c ] ¶ We are three Players who wish to kill this Master.

[2] (P224.S1)
One wishes to thrust with the point, the other to cut; the other wants to launch his sword with the fingers. Thus it is.

[3] (P224.S2)
So it will be a great deed that he is not dead.

[4] (P224.S3)
may God make him very sad.

[5] (P225.S0)
[ 21v-c ] ¶ This is a game that wishes to be armed, whoever wants to place such a point.

[6] (P225.S1)
When one attacks you with a thrust and a cut, you make the cover, and immediately place it upon him in the manner that is depicted.

[7] (P227.S0)
[ 20v-b ] ¶ I have found you uncovered in everything, and I have surely struck you in the head.

[8] (P227.S1)
And if I wish to pass with my foot forward, I could make many close plays against you, such as in bindings, breaks, and embraces.

[9] (P228.S0)
[ 20v-a ] ¶ What the master has said, I have done well, that I went off the path making good cover, and I found the player uncovered, so that I surely wish to put a point in his face, and with my weary hand I wish to try, if I can make your sword go to the ground.

[10] (P229.S0)
[ 20v-c ] ¶ I can wound you well with a cut and with a thrust.

[11] (P229.S1)
When I increase the reach, I can bind you in a middle bind that leads into the third play of the first master remedy of the dagger.

[12] (P229.S2)
Yet this play, which I have in mind, I can perform for you.

[13] (P229.S3)
And in such a way I can 
wound you, and also bind you.

[14] (P230.S0)
[ 20v-d ] ¶ Your sword and your arm are well imprisoned, and you cannot escape from it without being struck by me, for you show that you know little of this art.

[15] (P231.S0)
Here I can well strike you, and your sword I can take without fail.

[16] (P231.S1)
Turning it around the hand, I will make you spill, so that you must let go of the sword.

[17] (P232.S0)
[ 21r-b ] ¶ Here I can wound you in front.

[18] (P232.S1)
And this is not enough for me; for the blow that I intend for you, I will make you turn to strike you from the side, and I will throw the sword to your neck, so that you will not be able to guard against this.

[19] (P233.S0)
For that play that is before me, I will make you turn in that manner.

[20] (P233.S1)
And suddenly I thrust my sword to your neck.

[21] (P233.S2)
If I do not cut your throat, it is only because I am sad and foolish.

[22] (P234.S0)
If you thrust at me with a point, I will parry it to the ground.

[23] (P234.S1)
See that you are uncovered, and that I can wound you.

[24] (P234.S2)
I want to turn you around to make you heavier.

[25] (P234.S3)
And I will strike you directly in that middle.

[26] (P235.S0)
[ 21v-a ] ¶ For the time that I trusted you!

[27] (P235.S1)
to make a strike thinking of you through the elbow.

[28] (P235.S2)
To this part I have come well at once.

[29] (P235.S3)
For the sake of throwing you to the ground, so that you do not wage war against me or anyone else.

[30] (P236.S0)
[ 21v-b ] ¶ This one struck me on the head, and I parried his sword.

[31] (P236.S1)
I have come to this part.

[32] (P236.S2)
I will make you fly again, so as not to have failed.

[33] (P236.S3)
And the sword 
they placed at your throat, so bold am I.
