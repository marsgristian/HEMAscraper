[1] (P262.S0)
To cross with you at the point of the sword, from the other side the point is aimed at your chest.

[2] (P263.S0)
[ 19b-b ] For the strike that the master says, you must place the point of the sword quickly in the throat.

[3] (P264.S0)
To cross the sword, the weary arm will strike you, for the time is short; I will do it soon.

[4] (P265.S0)
[ 19b-d ] For the master who crosses in the middle of the sword, of that which he has said, I make you of that.

[5] (P266.S0)
[20a-a] Furthermore, for that very reason, crossing your sword in this manner, I have to take it and of the births!

[6] (P266.S1)
that your sword shall escape from my hand, I shall strike you as a vile crook.

[7] (P267.S0)
[ 20a-b ] The words of the master deny that there is any question about this, that the play which he has taught, I perform with reason.

[8] (P268.S0)
[20a-c] To pass off the road, I well discover you, and your arms I shall strike in the turn to pierce you.

[9] (P269.S0)
[ 20a-d ] To strike you in the arms, that play I make, And from the close play, I will make you high or low.

[10] (P270.S0)
[ 20b-a ] When the sword is aimed at the head, or thrust toward the throat, it would rather damage the arms than the head. For a shorter time, the measure is clear.

[11] (P271.S0)
[ 20b-b ] When I encounter one and I come to the close, Within the grips, the fierce one with the right foot.

[12] (P272.S0)
[20b-c] This is from the point of a cruel thrust in the most deceitful art of this, one cannot make it. You have moved me from the point, and here I have given it to you. And it can be made safer by avoiding the path.

[13] (P273.S0)
[ 20b-d ] For your maintenance that I hold in my hand, with the point in the face I make a sign to you.

[14] (P274.S0)
[ 21a-b ] Here we stand, we who are crossed in the art, to give you the greater knowledge of the plays that shall be bestowed.

[15] (P275.S0)
I will strike your point to the ground very quickly, and in such a way I will wound you, without a doubt.

[16] (P276.S0)
[ 21a-c ] For the crossing of the earth that the scholar makes, For my pretense, I come to you to strike, And your sword will break or bend, And it will no longer be able to work for anything.

[17] (P277.S0)
[ 21a-d ] Of the play that gives you an opening to strike the face, I do it very quickly.

[18] (P278.S0)
To pinch your elbow, I will make you turn, and in that, I will strike you without anyone noticing.

[19] (P279.S0)
For the strike that I give you to the elbow, I have struck you in the head directly, and immediately.

[20] (P280.S0)
[21b-c] I shall show you to evade from the right into the reverse, to deliver this thrust with pain and woe. False thrust by name, I make myself called. Thus, I am cruel, and with the sword, I shall make you bleed.

[21] (P281.S0)
[21b-d] For a false thrust that you wished to strike me, turning myself and the sword against you, I will defend myself so that the point you have placed in my face, in such a way that I have taken away all the play.
