[1] (P14.S0)
[ 1 ] OF THE TRUE ART OF wielding weapons.

[2] (P14.S1)
Cap.

[3] (P14.S2)
I.

[4] (P15.S0)
There is no doubt that the most honorable practice of arms is made perfect by two things, namely by judgment and by strength; for from the one is acquired the knowledge of the manner and the timing to act in whatever circumstance may arise, and from the other one becomes capable of executing all in due time and with advantage.

[5] (P16.S0)
For the knowledge of how to strike and defend oneself relies solely on the ability to reason, the purpose of this art is not in the saying but in the doing. Therefore, to succeed in it, one must not only have judgment but also the means to swiftly execute that which judgment comprehends and sees. This cannot be done if one lacks the strength and agility of the body, which, if it happens to be weak or slow, or unable to bear the weight of blows, will remain entangled when the time to strike requires action.

[6] (P16.S1)
These errors, as you can see, do not arise from the art itself but from the instrument poorly suited to execute it;

[7] (P17.S0)
But everyone will toil who wishes to engage in acquiring this strength, holding for certain that the judgment without this strength and skill is of little or no utility, but perhaps even harmful, because men hindered by judgment, in knowing how things ought to be done, set themselves to enterprises in which they afterward do not succeed in deeds;

[8] (P18.S0)
But because to say that strength is necessary for this art and not to provide a way to acquire it, being one of the two main principles, would undermine the art entirely, I have therefore decided at the beginning of this treatise to provide the means to acquire judgment, and in the end to create a treatise on how one can exercise oneself to gain strength and agility, in a manner pertinent to this art, so that anyone can, with the reasons that will be given, become their own master, swiftly and strongly.

[9] (P19.S0)
OF THE WAY TO ACQUIRE the art of fencing.

[10] (P19.S1)
FOR as much as I, having seen in all parts of Italy most excellent masters of this art, and having learned in their schools and practiced secretly to bring it into form: I do not know of having seen any who equally possessed this part of the judgment as it ought to be, unless they have it.

[11] (P20.S0)
And let them also hold it among many unregulated strikes, for they can produce very beautiful and most judicious ones; but be that as it may, having the intention to play in this art as much as I can, I wish in this part to say everything that seems appropriate to me.

[12] (P21.S0)
You must therefore know that a man becomes timid and bold to the extent that he knows how to avoid or not avoid danger.

[13] (P22.S0)
But to have this knowledge, it is necessary to continually keep in memory all the aforementioned warnings, from which the entire understanding of this art derives; it is not possible to do anything with reason or that is good without these. And it often happens that someone, without having known these, has done something with judgment and usefulness; this does not come from anything else but from the nature of the soul, which knows all these warnings by itself.

[14] (P23.S0)
These are those, that the straight line is the shortest of all, and therefore where one wishes to strike for the shortest, it is necessary to strike along the straight line.

[15] (P24.S0)
The second is, he who is closer arrives sooner, from which this usefulness arises: that seeing the sword of the enemy far away or high to strike, one strikes first before being struck.

[16] (P25.S0)
The third is that a circle which turns has greater force at the circumference than towards the center,

[17] (P26.S0)
The fourth that more easily withstands little strength than much strength,

[18] (P27.S0)
The fifth that every movement is made in time.

[19] (P28.S0)
That from these warnings one may derive judgment and clarity, for in this art, nothing else is sought but to strike with advantage and to defend oneself securely.

[20] (P29.S0)
which is done by striking in a straight line with the point, or with the edge, for the sword has more strength by striking first the enemy rather than being struck, which is done when one knows they are closer to the enemy, in which cases one thrusts forward, for few or none are there who, feeling themselves wounded, do not retreat rather than make any other motion they might have begun.

[21] (P30.S0)
And knowing then that every movement is made in time, one seeks to strike and defend by making as few movements as possible to consume little time, and by omitting many, the enemy can be kept alert to strike him, having made one or more times improperly consumed.

[22] (P31.S0)
OF THE DIVISION of the art.

[23] (P31.S1)
BEFORE coming to a more particular explanation of this art, it is necessary to divide it; hence it is to be known that just as in almost all other arts, in this one too, men, leaving behind the true science and perhaps hoping for more with falsehood than with the true victors, have found a new way of fencing full of tricks and deceptions, which, while being of some utility against those who are either timid or ignorant of the principles, has nevertheless forced me to divide this art into two, calling one true and the other deceitful; warning, however, that the deception against the true art brings no profit whatsoever, but rather, great harm and mortal danger to those who use it;

[24] (P32.S0)
Therefore, setting aside for the moment the deception which will be discussed later in its place, and confining myself to the truth, which is the true and principal desire of our soul, presuming that justice, being very close to the truth, is always superior in every circumstance, I say to anyone who wishes to practice in such a craft: it is necessary to have sound judgment, a spirited heart, and great swiftness; in which three things this entire exercise is maintained and lives.

[25] (P33.S0)
OF THE SWORD ANCHOR that the weapons used for offense as well as for defense are almost infinite, for everything that a man can employ to harm others or to defend himself, whether by throwing or holding in hand, seems to me to be called a weapon. Nevertheless, because those I have mentioned are countless, to wish to treat particularly of all of them would not only be a great labor, but also undoubtedly useless, for the principles and advice given herein serve for all the weapons used and that perhaps will be used. Therefore, leaving aside all those that do not contribute to our purpose, I say that among all the weapons used today, none is more honored, more practiced, nor simpler than the sword.

[26] (P34.S0)
where, this coming first as that, in which only the true science of this art is founded, being that for having a moderate length, cuts and point, it resembles much with each other, therefore it must be known that having no more than two cuts and one point, one cannot wound with others than these [5], nor should one avoid others than these, and all the cuts, whether straight or reverse, form either a circle or part of a circle of which the hand is the center, and the middle diameter is the length of a sword.

[27] (P35.S0)
Where it is necessary to strike with a cut for a great arc, or also with a thrust, it is necessary, I say, to be quick of hand and to know the timing of the advantage, which consists in knowing when one's own sword is closer to striking than that of the enemy. For if the enemy, to strike, turns his sword a span away, finding himself in that drop close to half a span, one should not concern oneself with parrying, but rather strike, for by advancing first, one sees the fall of the enemy's sword, being thus compelled to parry some cutting blow. For greater security and ease, one should aim to counter from half sword back, in which place the enemy's sword has less strength and is found closer to strike the enemy.

[28] (P36.S0)
As for the thrusting strikes, which are very perilous, one must seek to align oneself in such a way with the body, with the feet, and with the arms, that there is no need, while intending to strike, to lose a moment, which happens when one either extends the arm too far forward, or draws the feet too far back, or moves the body too hastily, so that before one can thrust, it becomes necessary to either withdraw the arm or shift the feet or make a motion with the body. By realizing this, the enemy may strike first before one is struck. However, by standing in the proper manner, one will know that one is less distant from the point of one's sword to the enemy than the enemy is from theirs to oneself, and in that case, one must swiftly and vigorously thrust, so that one may reach first.

[29] (P37.S0)
OF THE DIVISION OF THE SWORD

And since the effects of the length of the sword are not equal in every part, it is reasonable not only to make known the cause, but also to find the property and name of each part, so that each one may know which are the parts with which he must strike and with which he must evade.

[30] (P38.S0)
Elsewhere I have said that the sword, in striking, forms a circle or part of a circle, of which the hand is the center; and it is evident that a wheel that turns has greater force and speed at the circumference than towards the center, to which I refer, being very similar to the sword in striking; we seem to divide it into four equal parts; of which the one closest to the hand, as being closest to the cause, we shall mention first, the following second, then the third, and fourth the part that contains the point, of which we shall use the third and fourth to strike, for being more towards the circumference they are swifter, and the fourth, not at the point but four fingers further in, will be swifter and stronger than any other; because besides being at the circumference, for which they have greater speed, they also have four fingers of iron as counterweight that gives them greater fury in motion.

[31] (P38.S1)
The other two parts, the first and the second, we shall use for defense, for those meant for striking, having little range, possess little strength, and to resist a thrust, being close to the hand, which is the cause, are much stronger.

[32] (P39.S0)
[7] The arm is not equally strong and swift in every part; rather, due to the different bends, that is, at the wrist, the elbow, and the shoulder, the strike from the wrist, which is quicker but less powerful, and the other two, being stronger, are slower, for they take a greater arc. Therefore, in my counsel, one should not, when intending to strike with the edge, make the arc of the shoulder, for by carrying the sword too far away, one gives the alert enemy time to enter first. Instead, one should only use the arc of the elbow and the wrist, which, besides being very swift, are also strong when properly executed.

[33] (P40.S0)
Therefore, coming to what is our intent to discuss in this place, I will first say how the arm, when striking with the point, should strike circularly.

[34] (P41.S0)
It is a clear thing that all bodies of figure, whether straight or long, when they have one end fixed and immobile, and the other end moves necessarily and always while moving, will form one or part of a circular figure.

[35] (P41.S1)
Thus, being such a figure, the arm has its fixed and immobile part in the shoulder and moves only with the lower part; there is no doubt that it also forms, in moving, either a circle or a part of it, which anyone can recognize by their own example in moving their own arm.

[36] (P42.S0)
If this therefore is as it necessarily is, it will also be true that all those things that are attached to this arm, moving with the motion of this arm, must move circularly; and this is with regard to the first purpose.

[37] (P43.S0)
I will therefore come to the second and show the reasons for which, when striking with the point, one strikes correctly. I say that whenever the sword is moved solely by the motion of the arm, it will always and necessarily form a circle for the reasons already mentioned. But if it happens, as it almost always does, that the arm, in moving, describes a circle upwards, and the hand, moving in the hilt, forms a part of a circle downwards, then it will occur that this sword, moved by these two contrary motions while advancing, can strike correctly.

[38] (P44.S0)
And because it is clear that one should know the present figure for understanding, it is to be noted that just as the arm, in moving, carries back the sword, and due to the same motion it is propelled to form a circle, so too the hand, moving in its joint, can raise and lower the tip downward; thus, by lowering the hand, the tip of the sword is lowered as much as the arm raises the hilt, resulting in the sword being able to strike with the point at the straight line that is aimed at.

[39] (P45.S0)
Thus, the circle A B will be that which is made by the motion of the arm, which arm, if carrying the sword with it in its motion, would wish to strike accurately at the point.

[40] (P45.S1)
D. it would be necessary from its motion to strike at the point.

[41] (P45.S2)
And from this arises the difficulty of striking correctly with the point.

[42] (P45.S3)
If therefore he wishes to strike correctly with this arm at the point, it will be necessary that as he raises the hilt, the hand's knot moves circularly downward, forming the circle A C. By pulling the tip of the sword downward with it, it necessarily causes it to strike at the point.

[43] (P45.S4)
D. which would not happen if with a single motion of the arm which moves above the center E.

[44] (P46.S0)
[ 11 ] GREAT consideration is required for the steps in this exercise, for from them, more than from anything else, arise the offenses and defenses; and the guard must likewise be maintained with all diligence, firm and low, turned towards the enemy more quickly with the right shoulder than with the chest, and this is to make oneself a lesser target than possible. And having it held somewhat bent, one should ensure that it bends back more quickly than forward, so that it is distant from the offense, for the guard can never move maximally in any part unless the head in that same part does not move, which is of such great importance.

[45] (P47.S0)
But when one wishes to strike, one must thrust forward the feet or the arms according to what is most advantageous in that case, for when it happens that one can boldly seize the enemy without advancing the step, this must be done and one should use only the arms, always keeping the body as steady and immobile as possible.

[46] (P48.S0)
where the manner of fencing of those who at one moment make themselves small, at another large, and at times twist to one side and then to the other, resembling snakes, is not praised; for all these are movements, and one cannot perform so many at once. Hence, if they are low, to strike high they must first rise, and in that time they can be struck; and similarly when they are turned to one side or the other.

[47] (P49.S0)
Therefore, one shall remain in the manner described, striving with all one's might to either strike or defend, doing so not in two times and two motions, but in the middle, time and motion if it be possible.

[48] (P50.S0)
As for the movement of the feet from which great offenses and defenses arise; having many examples, just as knowing how to move them orderly and reasonably causes, yes, no, stakes, as in the quarrels that are made entirely of this, honorable victory, so too does moving them too much and without reason lead to great damages and shame, for which it cannot be given a certain measure due to the diversity of men, both tall and short, to some of whom it is as if to take a step of an arm's length, to others of half or more; therefore, each one should be careful to form a moderate step in all the guards, so that one may, wishing to extend to strike, lengthen one foot, and likewise shorten it to save oneself, without the danger of falling;

[49] (P51.S0)
But because the feet in this exercise move well in various ways, it is good to name each action, as you must understand them throughout the operation.

[50] (P52.S0)
[ 14 ] OF THE CONVENIENCE OF THE FOOT & THE HAND.

[51] (P52.S1)
THE RIGHT LEG must always be the strength of the right hand, and similarly, the left leg of the left hand; thus, whenever it happens to thrust a point, it must be accompanied by the leg, for otherwise, due to the fury and the weight that is outside the perpendicular line of the life, having no support underneath, one runs the risk of falling. And it must be known that as naturally as the step grows and diminishes, so does the hand; therefore, it is seen that when the foot desires to go back, the hand is also found there, and by striving to stand otherwise, one does violence to nature, and it cannot endure. Hence, when forming a guard with the hand extended, the foot must also be directed strongly towards that part; when the hand is low and similarly the foot desires to advance, wishing to raise the hand high, it is also necessary to withdraw the foot. And the distance is from the place where the foot departs to unite with the other foot, as much as from the place where the hand departs to that place where it stops or a little less.

[52] (P52.S2)
Therefore, standing with all the aforementioned cautions, one must take great care in moving the step in time with the hand, and above all, not to make leaps, but to always have one foot firm and stable, and to move it with great reason, ensuring that it must primarily agree in motion with the hand, which should not deviate at all from its purpose of striking or defending due to any circumstance.
