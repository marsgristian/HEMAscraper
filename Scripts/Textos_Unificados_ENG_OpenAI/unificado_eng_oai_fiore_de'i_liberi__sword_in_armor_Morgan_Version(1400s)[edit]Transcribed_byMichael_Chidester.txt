[1] (P314.S0)
[ 10r ] Here begins the sword of armizare.

[2] (P314.S1)
Good evening, master, who will perform such plays.

[3] (P314.S2)
The masters are both here and stand in guard.

[4] (P314.S3)
To cover and to strike shall not delay anything.

[5] (P314.S4)
And whoever knows more in this art of theirs, of all their games shall have a part.

[6] (P315.S0)
In the brief guard of the serpent, I wish to come.

[7] (P315.S1)
If you are not well armed, I will make you feel it well; for striking with the point, I hold myself better than the other guards.

[8] (P315.S2)
For with the cuts of the cross, I mark myself and can do nothing.

[9] (P315.S3)
In arms and without arms, I wish to prove it.

[10] (P316.S0)
[ 10r-b ] I am set to make a true cross against you.

[11] (P316.S1)
In me, your points cannot enter.

[12] (P316.S2)
I will cover myself from you in the passing that I will make.

[13] (P316.S3)
And with the point I shall strike you without fail.

[14] (P316.S4)
That you and the other guards can do little to me.

[15] (P316.S5)
So well I arm myself.

[16] (P316.S6)
That I cannot fail to cross.

[17] (P316.S7)
That in passing and in crossing, and in striking, the art aims not to fail in this.

[18] (P316.S8)
And I will put all your points, and I will not fail for certain to come beyond, and among you low, the point you upright.

[19] (P317.S0)
[ 10r-c ] Sompuo[!]

[20] (P317.S1)
Serpentine are the high ones, and well-armed, I suddenly thrust a great point under the hand, for they are in and out of the plane.

[21] (P317.S2)
A strong thrust will put you down if you let it pass.

[22] (P317.S3)
She is my art that I know how to do well, of your cuts I care not at all, for I am well versed in the art.

[23] (P317.S4)
That with a great point I shall give you a great part.

[24] (P318.S0)
[ 10r-d ] Of iron is called the middle door, for I arm myself and make the points strong.

[25] (P318.S1)
And he went off the path with the tired foot, and I struck him with a thrust to the face.

[26] (P318.S2)
Either that the point and with the edge between your arms I will place you in the middle bind.

[27] (P318.S3)
In that which is given to us, it is depicted and named.

[28] (P319.S0)
[10v-a] The position called "sagittaria" is named thus, a great point I set outside of the path, and if a blow or cut comes against me, I make a good cover, and immediately I strike my opponent.

[29] (P319.S1)
This is my art that does not waver.

[30] (P320.S0)
[ 10v-b ] Of true crosses, I am a bastard placed.

[31] (P320.S1)
So that she can willingly do it.

[32] (P320.S2)
Good covers and thrusts and cuts I make for use.

[33] (P320.S3)
Always avoiding the blows off the path.

[34] (P320.S4)
And of my strikes, I make a great deal of noise.

[35] (P321.S0)
[ 10v-c ] From the true cross guard, I am in the position with this cover passing outside the road at the crossway.

[36] (P321.S1)
And of this cover, you will see that which I can do.

[37] (P321.S2)
For my students, I can show it.

[38] (P321.S3)
That they make my plays in complement.

[39] (P321.S4)
Here those who are to fight will demonstrate the art without a doubt.

[40] (P322.S0)
[ 10v-d ] And I am the first scholar of the master who has taught me, and this point I make as the essence of his teaching.

[41] (P322.S1)
I also say that from the guard of the true cross, and from the guard of the bastard cross, one can make this thrust, and I say immediately how the player, between a thrust to the master or scholar who is in the said guards, or posts, the master or scholar should go low with the person and pass outside of the line, crossing the line, and with the point raised to the face or to the chest, with the sword maintained low as depicted here.

[42] (P327.S0)
[ 11r-a ] When the scholar who has been denounced to me cannot play the player with the point, and he has grown weary of his right foot.

[43] (P327.S1)
And the point of his sword he puts underneath, the throat to throw him to the ground as depicted here.

[44] (P328.S0)
[ 11r-b ] This scholar who is in front of me cannot throw the player to the ground with the point of his sword, and when his foot is tired behind his right, he passes with his right foot behind his tired one, and the sword he throws at the neck.

[45] (P328.S1)
And this play I make here in his exchange.

[46] (P332.S0)
[ 11r-c ] Furthermore, I say that I am the fourth student whom our master can make this play for the cover that he has made, so that he may pass with the right foot in front.

[47] (P332.S1)
And the point of his sword should be placed under his right arm.

[48] (P332.S2)
And when the weary arm follows the sword.

[49] (P332.S3)
And when he has passed with his weary arm, his right under the elbow.

[50] (P332.S4)
It revolts in the lower binding without a doubt.

[51] (P332.S5)
What he has not done for himself, I shall do.

[52] (P332.S6)
He brings honor and I embrace it.

[53] (P334.S0)
[ 11r-d ] My master has shown me that when I am armed.

[54] (P334.S1)
And one wishes to put the point in my face in such a manner.

[55] (P334.S2)
That I should place the point of my sword under his weary hand.

[56] (P334.S3)
And he should pass with the right foot straight to his stance, and in such a way he may strike him with the pommel or with the elbow in the face.

[57] (P334.S4)
As I have this scholar that I am about to make.

[58] (P334.S5)
If I pass it, I make such a play that it cannot fail me.

[59] (P335.S0)
[ 11v-a ] What the student says is that in front of me there is no fault that I can do these two plays that are before me, namely to strike you first with the pommel in the face, and to throw you to the ground.

[60] (P335.S1)
The other that follows, which is the second, can be done by raising the point of the sword and maintaining it, and with that one can strike in the ear and in the jaw, in such a way that he will go to the ground without doubt.

[61] (P336.S0)
[ 11v-b ] The student who stands before the master, and is well informed that the pommel will strike you in the face and throw you down to the ground, in such a way that it will not spare your belly nor your head.

[62] (P337.S0)
[ 11v-c ] This play has not failed, as the second scholar has said before, that I could come to this play that strikes you in the ear and in the jaw, to send you to the ground I am certain.

[63] (P337.S1)
You will walk on the flat and I will stand upright.

[64] (P338.S0)
[ 11v-d ] Of the master and of his students, I care little.

[65] (P338.S1)
This counter I make against him with good measure, that is when he comes with the cover, and I with my weary arm deflect his with my arm at the elbow.

[66] (P338.S2)
And for such a way, thus taken, defense cannot be made and one can be offended.

[67] (P338.S3)
Yet another contrary could be done.

[68] (P338.S4)
As my weary hand could turn it for its elbow.

[69] (P338.S5)
That such play in arms and without arms can be well done.
