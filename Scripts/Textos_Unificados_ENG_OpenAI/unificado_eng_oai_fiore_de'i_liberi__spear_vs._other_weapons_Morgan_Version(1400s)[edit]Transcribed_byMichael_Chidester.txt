[ 18r-c ] In this part, it is about the staff and dagger against the spear. The scholar awaits the one with the spear in all iron guard, turning the body, and not moving the feet from the ground in the staff's reverse part, straight.

[2] (P370.S1)
And as he who wields the lance among the scholar with his lance.

[3] (P370.S2)
The student increases the pace by stepping off the path, parrying, and avoiding the thrust.

[4] (P370.S3)

[5] (P374.S0)
[ 8r-c ] Here are three companions who wish to strike this master. The first wishes to strike under the arm while holding his spear at half-length; the second holds his spear at rest, ready to strike; the third wishes to thrust with his spear. And it is agreed that no one shall make more than one blow per man, and they must also take turns, one after the other.

[6] (P375.S0)
[ 8v-a ] This game is of the master who stands before, waiting with the spear against these horsemen in the teeth of the boar.

[7] (P375.S1)
In passing off the path and countering what he does, he enters into this play, and for this to be understood, I do it in his place.

[8] (P375.S2)
That with edge and point I can strike him in the head.

[9] (P375.S3)
Thus I carry my lever well ready.

[10] (P376.S0)
[ 8v-c ] Furthermore, this play of the aforementioned master that I declare in the position of thrusting in his exchange, I perform this that he can do, when the lance is parried, I turn my lance and strike him with the pommel.

[11] (P376.S1)
That this sword is tempered and entirely sharp.
