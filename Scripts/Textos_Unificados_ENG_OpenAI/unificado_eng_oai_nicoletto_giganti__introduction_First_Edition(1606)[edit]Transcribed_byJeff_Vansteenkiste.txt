[vii] TO THE SIG.

[2] (P3.S1)
READERS, ALMORO LOMBARDO was of the Most Illustrious Lord Marco.

[3] (P3.S2)
In wishing to write on the subject of arms, although the author does not mention it, it seems to me a necessary thing, O Noble Readers, to discuss what part it holds, and by what name it is adorned, and this so that everyone may understand the greatness, the dignity, and the privilege of it.

[4] (P3.S3)
Before anyone studying this most noble science reads and discusses the learned and easy observations of this valiant and knowledgeable professor Nicoletto Giganti, I, in order to observe the rule and the general precept of those who wish to treat of any matter, will come to the definition and then to the general division of this term Science, from which two things will ultimately come into consideration for anyone that this beautiful profession shows us.

[5] (P3.S4)
The Science, therefore, is a certain and manifest knowledge of things that the intellect acquires: and this is of two kinds, namely Speculative and Practical.

[6] (P3.S5)
The Speculative is a simple operation of the intellect concerning its own object.

[7] (P3.S6)
The Practice consists solely in the current operations of the intellect.

[8] (P3.S7)
The Speculative is divided into two parts, namely into Real Speculative and into Rational Speculative.

[9] (P3.S8)
The true aim is at the reality of its object, which demonstrates its essence in the exterior.

[10] (P3.S9)
The rationale consists of those things that only the intellect provides him, nor does it wish for his being to extend any further.

[11] (P4.S0)
Physics is a speculative real science, which solely aims at mobile and natural things, such as the elements.

[12] (P4.S1)
Mathematics is a true speculative science, which only extends its being in as much as it is continuous and discrete; continuous as concerning lines, circles, and surfaces; and the measures of these are treated by Arithmetic.

[13] (P4.S2)
The Grammar, the Rhetoric, the Poetry, the Logic are rational speculative sciences.

[14] (P5.S0)
The practical science is also divided into two, into Active and Passive; Active is Ethics, Politics, and Economics; then the Passive is further divided into seven others, which are called mechanical, and these are the Wool Industry, Agriculture, Mercenary Soldier, Navigation, Medicine, Hunting, and the Crafting Art.

[15] (P6.S0)
Now, to come to what I have promised above regarding this noble science, I will discuss its qualities and nature, that is, whether it is a Speculative Science or a Practical one.

[16] (P6.S1)
I, for my opinion, say, and I prove it with various reasons that it is Speculative.

[17] (P6.S2)
And that it is a science there is no doubt, for this is not acquired except through the operation of the intellect, from which it is born; that it is Speculative is certain since it consists of nothing other than the simple knowledge of its object, as I shall show further below: And the object of this science is nothing other than the parry and the strike; the knowledge of these two things is the work of the intellect; nor does the professor of this science extend further with his ingenuity than in the knowledge of these two things, which no one can know unless he first has knowledge of the times, and of the measures, or of Feints, or of Cavation, or of resolutions without knowledge of the times and the measures, and these are all operations of the intellect, and outside of this knowledge the intellect does not extend further; for as I have said, the aim of this profession is to know how to parry; but let us see if it is truly speculative, or rationally speculative.

[18] (P6.S3)
I go on considering that it cannot be rational, and the reason is that—[ ix ] it stands, for if indeed it is an operation of the intellect; nonetheless, it further expands; for I find it to be a real speculative.

[19] (P6.S4)
Royal, because the knowledge of its purpose is shown to us by the intellect externally; for the ability to strike, and the ability to defend with timing, measures, feints, openings, and resolutions, although they are operations of the intellect, cannot be known except externally, and this exterior consists in the posture of the body, and of the sword in the guards and counter-guards, which all consists in circles, angles, lines, surfaces, measures, and numbers; which things, although they must be observed, can be read in Camillo Agrippa, and in many other professors of this science.

[20] (P6.S5)
But note that just as those operations of the intellect cannot be shown without an exterior operation, so these exterior operations cannot be known without the primary operations of the intellect, in such a way that this science cannot be known, which derives from the intellect, except externally; nor can it be known externally without the operation of the intellect, which operations, to wish to know the greatness, excellence, and perfection of this profession, will always be seen united; and just as there will never be a Sun without day, nor day without Sun, so those will never be without these, nor these without those.

[21] (P6.S6)
It remains for us to see what a true speculative science it is.

[22] (P6.S7)
This science of the Sword, or of arms, is a Speculative science, truly Mathematical, and is of Geometry and Arithmetic; of Geometry because it consists of lines, circles, angles, surfaces, and measures.

[23] (P6.S8)
Of Arithmetic, because it consists of numbers; it is not the motion of the body, which does not form an angle or a bond; it is not the motion of the Sword, which does not move in a line; it is neither guard nor counter-guard, which does not proceed by number; the observation of all these things depends on the knowledge of times and measures; hence I conclude that this most noble science is a Speculative real Mathematics, of Geometry and Arithmetic, as I have mentioned briefly above.

[24] (P7.S0)
But perhaps some curious person might argue about this saying that the science of the - [ x ] weapons is a practical science, with this reasoning that being a practical science, it is a science which not only extends into the knowledge of its own object, but also in the operation within it; and the science of the Sword being a science that not only pertains to knowledge, but to the operation of it, therefore this science is Practical, and not Speculative.

[25] (P7.S1)
To that opposition, I respond; all things have some operation from nature.

[26] (P7.S2)
And there are three sorts of our operations; some are internal, and these have their being in pure and simple intellect, deriving from a speculative rationality; some are both internal and external, and these share a commonality in the intellect and outside, arising from a real speculative; some are entirely external, and these have their being completely outside the intellect, depending on a practical science, and are either active or effective: the real effective speculative science is not different from practical science except in this, that the real speculative, although it operates externally on its object, still serves the cognition of it within the intellect, whereas practical science, besides not being able to operate except externally on its object, cannot even come to the cognition of it except externally. The science of arms has the cognition of its object within the intellect; although it operates externally, it cannot be said to be practical, but rather a real speculative science.

[27] (P8.S0)
We have thus seen what science it is, and it is the Mathematics of Geometry and Arithmetic, because it consists of numbers, lines, and measures, of which the author makes no mention in his observations, for learned individuals and those of no study alike gain some fruit from them. Hence, everyone from the present figures and from his lessons knows that without learning to understand the multiplicity of lines, circles, angles, and surfaces, which would rather confuse the mind of the Reader who does not have knowledge of these studies, they would not provide any instruction; he will undoubtedly learn to know, without doubt and without effort, the times, the measures, the resolutions, the feints, the parries, and the way to know how to defend and how to strike.

[28] (P9.S0)
[ xi ] Then, regarding the knowledge of circles, lines, and the other matters mentioned above, every student will come to an understanding of them through practice in this art; and I will always advise each one to first apply themselves to the study of letters rather than to this profession, for he who has studied for the knowledge he will have of the necessary things concerning this science will gain more profit, and will become more excellent and more perfect, and in a much shorter time, through the acquisition that can be made by knowing the aforementioned things about guards and counter-guards, both covered and uncovered; whereas one who has not studied will not achieve this so easily; and although he might learn, he will not acquire the knowledge of this science without a lengthy period of time and continuous practice.

[29] (P10.S0)
This profession, of how much dignity it is, and of how much consideration, and what decorum it seeks, and what reputation, and how much honor is due to it, and in what obligation one is, who bears the sword and makes a profession of it, I shall say that its dignity and its consideration all derive from its qualities, of which, with the division of the same, one can come to knowledge.

[30] (P10.S1)
This science of the Sword is divided into three parts; the first is divided into two, into natural and artificial: The natural is a demonstrative discourse, which man uses naturally, both in defense and in striking; for with his own ingenuity he goes with those terms drawing, which master nature provides him out of necessity, and from this it is that many men of heart and spirit have shown great comparison of this in their matters with men of great skill and much knowledge;

[31] (P11.S0)
The Artful one, which through ingenuity and long practice, and exercise discovers under short rules and impossible methods, various ways of knowing how to defend and how to strike with the aforementioned things: hence, coming to some occasion, a man draws from this the true terms of the safety of his person, of which two qualities the author demonstrates in his lessons a grand knowledge, and the reader of them will be fully satisfied.

[32] (P12.S0)
The second part is this, that the science of the artificial Sword is divided into two: into Demonstrative and into Exercised. The Demonstrative is that which demonstrates the true way and purpose of knowing how to defend and how to strike, both from a firm stance and in passing, and when one should press the enemy and when one should retreat according to those lines, and those circles, and those circumstances mentioned above, through which the intellect is regulated, and shares the various and multiple postures and counter-postures of the body. The Exercised is the very same Demonstrative, which, once we have acquired it, we apply to the knowledge of a thousand cautions; in nothing is one different from the other, except that the Demonstrative is in itself, and the Exercised is in how it serves the knowledge of different things.

[33] (P13.S0)
The third part is this: the Demonstrative science of the Sword is divided into two: the first Demonstrative consists of incomplete terms, that is, in simple or compound terms, which unite within themselves multiple terms that are Demonstrative of various accidents, and these are such as being out of measure, with arms open, weapons high or low, which terms are called incomplete terms, that is, terms not understood by the enemy; they are called simple because they are natural; they are called compound because they contain many considerations, and these are divided into first and second concepts: The first concepts are the real things, which are first learned by the intellect, such as defending and striking, and these go into the first intention; The second concepts formed by the intellect are these, and they make our second intention, the knowledge, in order to be able to strike and defend; which are done through the first; for our intellect, as soon as it has this end of striking and defending, immediately discourses on how it can do this in various ways and with different methods: The second Demonstrative consists of complex terms, that is, in terms that unite within themselves multiple terms that are Demonstrative in themselves, which terms, whether united in measure or separated in distance, demonstrate their purpose, such as being in guard closed in arms demonstrates either in distance or in measure of the posture of the body or counter-posture the purpose of that, whatever it may be, and how many things can be done with it; therefore, one sees how much consideration this beautiful science holds for its qualities and for the terms it contains.

[34] (P14.S0)
This, therefore, as it is of great dignity, being a true Speculative Mathematics, of Geometry and Arithmetic, and for as many parts as it finds beneath itself, thus I say it seeks decorum and reputation, nor will there be any other decorum and reputation for it, if not this.

[35] (P14.S1)
And it must be considered, O Readers, that this science is mostly found in royal courts, and of every Prince; in the most famous Cities studied by Barons, Counts, Knights, and persons of great quality; and not for any other reason, but because, just as it is noble, it excites and inflames our spirits towards great things, towards enterprises, and towards heroic deeds, to make a comparison of the virtue of the soul, the valor of the body, the strength, the fortitude, and the dexterity of the person.

[36] (P14.S2)
This constant search for equality does not allow for any charge to be made against it; it wishes to be known and understood, but does not profess, nor does it adopt every folly; it shuns the contention of base individuals; it does not do all that it can; it reveals itself at the right time and place; it avoids the practices of debauchery; it speaks few words; it desires a serious demeanor, a lively eye; an honorable dress, and a noble practice; and this is all regarding its decorum and reputation.

[37] (P15.S0)
As for the honor that is due to it, it must be noted that the observance of all these matters is an honor to the said profession; it remains only to say what obligation lies upon him who bears the Sword: we shall set aside the terms of these Duelists, who, just as they have misunderstood the said profession, so I say with many of their proposals they debase it; and they have reduced it to such an unfortunate state, that not only have they set aside the virtuous life that seeks such knowledge, and human discourse, and all reason; but forgetting the great God, and themselves to achieve their unjust ends, they possess it only for the damnation of their souls, postponing divine worship to their diabolical thoughts.

[38] (P16.S0)
This profession, O Readers, obliges those who practice it to all that you will understand; it must be considered that this is to be used on four occasions: first for Faith, then for the Fatherland, for the defense of one’s own life, and finally for honor. And this must always be a defender of reason, nor does it ever cling to wrong; and he who clings to wrong does injury to this profession; nor will a man of honor ever be held to fight for the wrong, but rather for the things stated; one must have occasion, for fighting without occasion is the act of fools and drunks.

[39] (P17.S0)
Some, as they have acquired some principles of this, take the sword to their side and engage in a thousand insolences, either by standing firm or by wounding, and sometimes even killing some poor wretch, believing they are gaining honor and fame; and they do wrong, for besides committing an outrage against the nobility of this art, which should not be put to use except with reason, they offend just God and themselves.

[40] (P17.S1)
I shall not be longer so as not to bore, but I only urge each one to study this noble and royal science, beseeching them to pay attention to the following observations of our learned professor, and to practice them, for the brevity of time will not be without great fruit, observing what is fitting for honor, glory, and the greatness of oneself.
