[1] (P2.S0)
[ 3.1 ] And now, speaking of the Sword alone, which is the principal of all other weapons, I shall begin to discuss it briefly in this manner: Primarily, the man who wishes to wield this kind of weapon must position his body in this way: that is, the right foot forward, standing in profile, bending slightly the right knee in a half-step, with the arm of the sword extended, ensuring that the fist is held high above the head by a palm's length, and that the tip of the sword points perpendicularly towards the chest of the enemy, striking with a thrust or a cut as he sees fit, according to the timing, and he must be quick to deliver the blow, and be ready to return to his original stance, making sure that the strikes are long, extending the body and lengthening the step as much as possible; and having acquired this habit through much practice, he will be able to do the same even in anger, as if it were natural to him.

[2] (P2.S1)
And then it will be possible in this guard to practice the striking of the hand, the evasion of the waist, either backward or to the side, according to what the moment may bring.

[3] (P2.S2)
And this can serve in many occasions in the play of the sword for this first form.

[4] (P3.S0)
[ 3.2 ] There is also the second lower form, which is called the straight line, governed by holding the arm extended along the line of the shoulder, making the sword's guard face the enemy's shoulder, sometimes covering the face under the guard, bowing the head towards the shoulder of the sword: and standing in this form, if the enemy strikes you with a knife straight to the head, you can parry from the inside, meeting towards the face at the same time; if he strikes a blow from above to the head, you can parry from the outside, and meet towards the face: and if he strikes at the leg, while you remain in this form, you can meet towards the face, or lower, pulling back the leg close to the other: and it is to be noted that reason dictates, that if someone strikes at the leg with the sword alone, it can be met at the point of your sword with the face, without you needing to parry, as many do, who attempt to parry the leg with the sword.

[5] (P3.S1)
Two, that play of the sword alone, which is in a straight line, and one falls to the leg, he always brings the head forward: and if he meets the sword of the enemy, (as is an easy thing,) you will find that the sword of that first cannot reach this: Hence I do not approve of striking at the leg when the sword of the enemy is present, for it brings great danger: one can well strike with the sword alone against the sword at the leg, but seek the time to lift oneself from the presence of the enemy's sword, or to cover the cut, and immediately respond to the leg, quickly jumping back to escape the encounter that the sword may make to the face when it falls to the leg.

[6] (P4.S0)
[ 5.2 ] With the life-avoiding movement to the side, you can strike at the leg, but be sure to avoid where the enemy's sword is located, for with the life-avoiding movement to the side, if you are not quick to pass away, you may be struck on the head by the right hand, or by the reverse depending on which side you pass: therefore I say that striking at the leg with the sword alone is very dangerous, if the man does not have ample time to do so, or great quickness of movement does not serve him.

[7] (P4.S1)
If a man, for a stab that goes to the leg, with the sword, brings danger, that he may receive a blow to the head, thus it will not seem so, but the best is to thrust the point in a straight line, drawing the leg a little towards him, and turning the body, for he will easily strike the enemy.

[8] (P4.S2)
Two, who also play with the sword alone, it must be warned that while one will deliver a thrust, you can meet with the sword, and at the same time wound, and easily: for it is a great advantage to wait for the other to strike, and the reason is that by striking first, you bring the weak into your strong: thus you being in a straight line, however he strikes you, either inside or outside, you can easily meet him, turning the wrist according to the side where the enemy comes to wound; that is, if he strikes from the inside, you can meet with the strong, turning the wrist slightly, so that the enemy's sword will remain outside of presence, and yours can wound at that very moment: if he strikes from outside towards the shoulder of the sword, you can meet with the strong of the sword, bringing the hilt a little forward towards the face. I warn that the strong of the sword is from the fittings going towards the tip a measure of one arm.

[9] (P4.S3)
And if the enemy wishes to gain your sword, be quick of eye, for when he moves with his sword, before he has gained an advantage over yours, do not take your time, but free your sword at that very moment, and enter, for he makes two moves, one to gain the sword, and the other to strike, and you do nothing but the motion of not allowing him to gain the sword, and at the same time, strike: and if by chance you could not employ that diligence and quickness that would gain you the sword, be careful not to force it, for you would accomplish nothing, but you can free yourself in this manner, that is, by pulling back a little, with the avoidance of life, and your sword will be free, and thus you can then continue to strike, either by gaining the enemy, or by stopping in guard: to enter according to what time brings you: where if he were to throw a great thrust, meet it with the strong part of your sword, and enter at that very moment, that you may easily parry and strike in one motion: if he throws a thrust, where you have only the sword, you must keep an eye on the sword, to know where the point of the enemy's sword may fall, and how you find yourself close: for if you find yourself close to the enemy, you must be careful to evade from which side the sword falls: and while the point comes down, you must meet it with the strong part, escaping with a slight avoidance to the side, that is, dodging the point, but be careful not to evade in such a way that your sword with the point goes out of a straight line, and in the presence of the enemy, for you can easily strike at that very moment, observing this dexterity: if the enemy thrusts at you, and you are not so close, you must know the distance, and make the escape of life backward, and not raise your sword in a straight line, nor in the presence of the enemy, for you can easily meet with the strong part of your sword, and strike; because by making the escape backward, the enemy brings his weak part into your strong part, and he cannot strike you unless he first gathers his step, or makes another longer move, that is, in this manner: having thrown the thrust, and it having gone empty, the enemy can again recover in this manner, that is, keeping his arm steady in a straight line, and being quick with the eye to recover his sword, which is found in the strong part, and then advancing the left foot before the right, making a long or short step, according to how you move: therefore, you must be quick with the eye, and with the leg, and take a position in the play, and not do as many do, who, having thrown their blow, and the enemy parries it, remain imperfect, and do not know how to take other positions, and do not consider that the other has the hands to parry and strike; and for this reason, you must have great regard not to rush into the hands of the enemy, considering what he can also do; and there will be many varied plays, such as one who waits for the enemy to strike first, and one who goes circling to gain time; who plays short, and who long, therefore I want to warn you against all these things.

[10] (P4.S4)
If the enemy circles around you, I do not want you to start wandering similarly, turning, as many do, but that you remain firm in your stance, and as he takes three or four steps to gain an advantage, either to one side or the other, and when he moves with his body, ensure that the tip of your sword always points at him. And when you recognize that your body is in such a way encircled that you do not keep him in your presence with the tip of your sword, take just one step in a small or large circle, according to the time you find, that is, whether the enemy circles you quickly or slowly.

[11] (P4.S5)
that when the enemy seeks to gain an advantage by stealing your time, he will take three or four steps forward, then you will only move your foot, which will be positioned in the manner I have described above, and thus no one with this rule will be able to steal your time: and you have another advantage, that while the enemy seeks to outmaneuver you, you can strike with the advantage of that time, for he thinks he is stealing your time, and in that instant you can wound him, taking it from him, and also strike in that moment alone, where you perceive that the opening is exposed, and be quick in delivering the blow, and swift in recovering the blade.

[12] (P4.S6)
It is necessary to warn at this time, which I shall speak of below, that it is most advantageous, governing yourself in this manner.

[13] (P4.S7)
Whenever you are in a straight line, and the enemy wishes to begin striking you, as would be in this manner; if he wants to deliver a thrust, I want you to push your sword forward while he raises his arm to strike you, so that easily before he has brought down the blow, you can wound him with great advantage. And if you consider well with the eye governing the sword in this manner, you will find that when the enemy lowers his sword, he brings it into your strong, and likewise when the enemy begins to want to make certain hand knots for the head, I want you to meet him face to face, and you will easily wound him at one time only, being aware of the enemy's sword whether it strikes inside or outside, for you can parry and wound by meeting him, either inside or outside according to where he strikes.

[14] (P4.S8)
But when it happens that the enemy can do nothing with the play of the hand's knot, you could easily withdraw into guard, and at that moment you must thrust in a straight line, and be ready to strike at the time he takes to adjust into guard. This is the reason that when the enemy is in your presence, and wishes to change guard, you can strike at that moment, for it is easy to hit.

[15] (P4.S9)
Now, when he retreats in such a way that you cannot strike him, be ready to rise up quickly with your leg, always keeping the sword at the ready against the enemy.

[16] (P4.S10)
And if he makes a feint from the outside or from the inside, beware not to go with the sword to the belief of wanting to parry, for if you do, he may easily draw from the other side and wound you in that moment, but observe this rule.

[17] (P4.S11)
Every time someone makes a feint at you, counter it with that first time, for the enemy makes two times: one to feint, and the other to strike, while you do nothing but one time to strike.

[18] (P4.S12)
I praise the feint in this manner, while you are in a straight line; I want you to make a motion to enter through the face, which is an easy thing, as the enemy will go to parry, and you, seeing where he goes to place his sword, which will be towards that part you indicate or feign, at that moment without withdrawing your sword, you will find a single time to enter, that is, you govern your actions with the strong to safeguard yourself from his sword, should he strike at that moment, as would be in this form: while you make the motion, and as your sword begins to move, it is clear that the enemy will place his sword to parry and strike, and you, with your eye alert, enter through that opening, where the enemy widens to parry your blow, and you can enter at a single time, without making certain withdrawals, as many do, who make the feints: and these warnings are demanded against the most subtle times so that they do not fall under the consideration of all.

[19] (P4.S13)
And likewise you shall make the feint to enter, and that the enemy does not go to the belief, continue entering with the same feint, and take care that when you make the feint, to always do it where the part is found most uncovered, for you put the enemy in necessity to parry, and you make him take [12.1] two actions, where you make but one, thus governing yourself with the eye, and with the caution if he stops, or if he goes to the belief of your sword.

[20] (P5.S0)
[12.2] Now I want to advise you on how to gain the sword from the enemy with its advantages, when you wish to seize the sword. It is clear that your strong point must surpass his weak point: therefore, one must have great knowledge to understand how the enemy stands with his life and with the sword, so that you may know the moment to move, and then you will begin to overcome his weak point with your strong point, using the motto, and descending slowly until you have reached the weak point of his sword. For if you rush in quickly, as I mentioned above, it may cause harm and wound you, and you cannot gain the sword from him; but if you approach slowly, you will easily gain it: and take care, once you have gained it, either from within or from without, not to let him recover it: for he will be forced to counter, and while he counters, you will follow him with the gain, or with the strike of that moment alone: and if you use the principles of the sword, as you have gained it once, you will follow him in such a way that he will no longer be able to recover it. And once you have gained the sword, and the enemy is not able, strike without hesitation at that moment of gain, and always employ your strong point, so that he cannot recover it.

[21] (P6.S0)
[ 13.1 ] And when you have gained the sword, you can use the gauntlet to take that of the enemy with the grip, that is, by squeezing it, and you will do so easily, and beware not to do as is the custom of many, who when one thrusts a stab want to seize the sword of the enemy with the left hand at that moment; for it is extremely difficult to do so: hence those who will use this rule will easily miss the sword, that is, they will not be able to seize it, and they may be struck, either in the chest or in the face, and the reason is that he who has only the sword, makes the reverse to put the weak part forward; for the sword can be varied in many ways, and thus it is easy to wound such a one who stands like this; among which I consider the best to thrust towards that strong part vigorously, for it cannot be that it does not strike him and put him in confusion.

[22] (P7.S0)
[ 13.2 ] There is also the game of running, as most of the French do, in which I want you to maintain a straight line whenever this occurs: thus the enemy comes running to strike you, and you restrain him by placing yourself in a solid stance in a straight line, exposed, so that he comes to disarm your sword. Recognize the distance, that is, when he approaches to make the disarm, and at the same time keep your eye on his sword, [ 14 ] noting that in wanting to disarm you, he will make a wide movement, whereupon you will meet him with your sword at the side, where he will be more exposed, and by evading his strike while avoiding his life, you will surely offend him.

[23] (P7.S1)
The exchange could take this form: to come with the false of his sword to disconcert you, so that in that instant you can meet him, that is, when he is near enough for you to reach him, and by easily freeing your sword a little, you can precipitate his, for he comes with force and is convinced of preventing you at the same time with the sword that he shows you in front, and to strike you or stab you in the leg while retreating, or to thrust at you by passing through. Therefore, observe the rule that I have told you about striking him when he comes to find the time and be warned that you will easily meet him at that moment only, standing firm and quick on your feet.

[24] (P7.S2)
But if you see someone coming at you with impetuosity, you must not fear, for in fearing you reveal a thousand deceptive movements, where the enemy can easily do what he has previously planned. But if you remain in the form I have described above, keeping your sword in presence, he remains imperfect in his approach, seeing that your sword always watches him in presence. And if by chance he runs forward without considering your sword, you will easily meet him and stop him halfway.

[25] (P8.S0)
[15.2] Now, if the enemy does not charge and takes a low stance, enter in a straight line; but surpass him in his weakness in such a way that, drawing upon yourself at the same time, as I have said, he cannot harm you, but his strike will go empty, as it will necessarily happen, meeting your strong point, to which you will have first attended, and thus you will not rush in, observing this: and here is the reason to restrain these hasty ones: and although many say that the reason of the sword is worthless, and that anger prevails, I do not approve of this, and I submit to the judgment of those knowledgeable men.

[26] (P8.S1)
And it is indeed true that the reason of arms, that is to say the game, is of no worth to those who allow their hearts to fail them in not doing their duty; hence they lose against both those who know and those who do not.

[27] (P8.S2)
There are still many other things regarding this straight line, which I leave for brevity to the judgment of the prudent reader, being most advantageous: therefore, I do not wish to say more on this, having spoken of the most useful and necessary matters, but we shall discuss the third guard and how it is governed.

[28] (P9.S0)
[ 15.3 ] The third guard is this: You must extend your right arm towards your right knee, keeping your fist away from the knee by about half an arm's length, [ 16 ] ensuring that the tip of the sword points high towards the enemy's face, slightly bending at the waist, but not to the point of falling, that is, making yourself somewhat small, ensuring that the right heel is aligned with the left foot at half a step, or more, or less, according to what seems most comfortable and stronger to you.

[29] (P9.S1)
And standing in this manner, if the enemy were to thrust at your face with a point, be sure to catch it with the strong part of the sword, either from the inside or from the outside, depending on which side he thrusts. And push all at once, lifting yourself from the back, for you will easily appear and strike at that moment.

[30] (P9.S2)
If he strikes you with a dagger, either straight or from the side, aiming for your head, and if he strikes lower, meet him likewise with that same straightness. And if he feigns an attack to the face or to another part of the body, do not rely on mere belief to parry, but thrust your sword at that moment, hitting his weak point with your strong one. If he strikes at your leg, pull your leg back a little and meet him, raising the guard of your sword and lowering the point, and be quick, for in this manner you will defend yourself from these blows. And if you lower that strike I have mentioned, that is, when he strikes at your leg, if you shift your body, the enemy will not be able to harm you in that part of the body, I mean if he, having struck at your leg, then wished to thrust.

[31] (P9.S3)
There is then the judgment, which teaches you to take a stance hand in hand, observing this form, and likewise you will defend yourself from many blows.

[32] (P9.S4)
Now I want us to speak of the passes, and to show you how much harm they can cause, and where their usefulness lies: Therefore, you will understand that the passes require their feints; and take heed, for they are very dangerous to those who do not execute them with great timing, agility, and quickness of life. And if you find yourself in the first form of the sword alone, and someone were to come to make a pass at you, seeing you high above, they will come to meet you to perform it. Be very careful, if the enemy were to make a feint to your face to pass by, as reason dictates, I do not want you to go to the feint otherwise, but rather that you take a slight step back with your body, where you think you can avoid the point of the feint, and all at once then strike with your hand and lower the thrust perpendicularly down to the body, for you could easily meet him if he bends well with his belly to the ground, and you will stop him, so he cannot pass: for the reason is this: while you do not go to the belief of the impetus that he makes with his feint, you have time to strike with your hand the point of his sword, and use the terms I mentioned above, and you break his design, for he comes at full speed to make the feint, and the pass of that moment.

[33] (P10.S0)
[18] And if you find yourself in a straight line in the second form, and the enemy comes with a feint to make a thrust, evade with a life-saving movement to the side, avoiding the point of his sword, where, as he passes, you can catch him on the head, and by turning your body, playing a little with your life, you can thrust your sword at his face likewise: and when the enemy feints at you, and at the same time wants to thrust, evade to the weak side; that is, if he feints inside, and you reverse the point towards his face, you will easily stop him, and you can also meet him lower on the body; because by keeping the point of your sword low, he can hardly thrust: and if he feints outside, he may step forward with the left foot, widening in a half-circle, bringing the right foot following the weak side, so that you will easily evade his presence, and you can deliver a thrust or a reverse cut: and if you wish to make a thrust, observe this: When you want to thrust, make the feint and the motion to thrust, but do not run, and easily the enemy, seeing you make the motion, that is, to carry your life out of the presence of his sword, might reverse the point of his sword towards the path where you make the motion to thrust, and at that moment you can cover his weak with your strong, and enter for the face without making another thrust; and if you want to make a free thrust, observe this rule: first gain his sword, and then enter for the face, for he must parry, and in parrying he will bring his sword out in such a way that you can thrust without danger, and if he does not parry, likewise you will catch him in the face: If you are in the third guard, and he makes a feint to thrust at your body with the sword low, I want you to make the life-saving movement, pushing the thrust with the point perpendicular, and keep a close eye on the enemy's sword, so that you can serve yourself with the life-saving movement, either from one side or the other: therefore, it is necessary to have great regard for the enemy's life: and to see how he moves, and to know the timing, and above all to be alert to the enemy's sword, that is, to consider with the eye, and with judgment from which side he may bring down his sword.

[34] (P10.S1)
And so much is enough to have said on this matter, although there are many other things, but these are very useful and most natural, from which a man can benefit.

[35] (P10.S2)
There are many still who propose other kinds of guards besides these, which I do not value at all, as they can all be reduced to these of mine.
