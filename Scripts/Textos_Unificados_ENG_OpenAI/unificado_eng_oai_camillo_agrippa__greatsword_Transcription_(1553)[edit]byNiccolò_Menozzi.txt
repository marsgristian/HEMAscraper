I had intended to speak further on how to wield the Great Sword: but upon better consideration, I realized that whatever could be said would be in vain, due to the uncertain nature of its strikes which go through the air. It seems to me, with the satisfaction of those who know how to use it, and to those who do not, to refrain from discussing it, as any advice or discipline given would only lead to a confusion of understanding, without the proper practice or actual demonstration by someone of the profession. I will only caution that when two are found with great swords, they may execute those very strikes that have been described above concerning the spear.
