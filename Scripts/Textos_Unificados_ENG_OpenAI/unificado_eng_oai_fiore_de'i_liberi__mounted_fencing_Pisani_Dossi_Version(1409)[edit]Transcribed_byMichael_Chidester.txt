[1] (P377.S0)
[ 29a-a ] I am the noble weapon by name lance, Beginning of battle and always my use. And whoever guards me with my pointed end, Becomes greatly afraid and turns to flight. And if at the beginning I fulfill my duty, With sword and dagger I carve my path.

[2] (P379.S0)
[ 29a-c ] To the point of the lance I carry my spear, To parry and to strike is always my practice.

[3] (P380.S0)
For the short spear that I have in the guard of the lady, I come to parry and to strike, indeed I hold myself.

[4] (P381.S0)
[ 29b-c ] To ruin your horse, I will do this throw, and then with my sword, I will come to meet you.

[5] (P382.S0)
[ 30a-b ] By thrusting, I cannot make another defense, and if I turn from the right, I will do you harm.

[6] (P383.S0)
With your sword, I will strike you with my lance, either with the point or with the edge, I will wound you.

[7] (P384.S0)
[30a-c] The opposite of your guard, I make Your horse wounded without any hindrance.

[8] (P385.S0)
[30b-d] Because you do not parry my lance out of the way, under the crooked arm I carry it aimed.

[9] (P386.S0)
[ 31a-a ] To the measure of the lance I come thus well assured That to parry my lance you shall not be tardy In striking your horse without fail, I believe You will see my strike with this here behind.

[10] (P387.S0)
[ 31a-c ] Because with your sword you cannot cross with me, I bring it low for your horse to be harmed.

[11] (P388.S0)
[ 31b-a ] Such a way of carrying the sword makes me perform four plays. From point and from edge I can strike without fail. Also, I can throw from horseback and wrestle with swords. Rarely have these things failed me.

[12] (P389.S0)
[ 31b-c ] Of these two guards, I make no comparison. He who knows more will be able to overcome his opponent, and he who knows how to guard against false plays will be safe. Those four plays, I say, can indeed be performed well.

[13] (P390.S0)
[ 32a-b ] This is a grappling and without advance in crossing. He who has more skill and cunning should begin to do it.

[14] (P391.S0)
[ 32a-a ] This point in the throat will be placed for the third master who shows such guard.

[15] (P392.S0)
[ 32a-c ] For the first master who stands in guard with his sword, this wound upon your head I have given to you.

[16] (P393.S0)
[ 32a-d ] To cross your sword, I would use mine, and with it, I would give you a real thrust. And thus I would have you, with the point, for the weapons that you do not have, do not mount against me.

[17] (P394.S0)
[ 32b-a ] You will lose your sword for this grip, or you will go to the ground without any defense.

[18] (P395.S0)
[32b-b] So that my sword may not be taken from me, against you I have made this vow, that what you wished to do to me, I shall do to you in return.

[19] (P396.S0)
[ 32b-c ] From horseback, it is fitting to engage in the earth. Then you shall know what you ought to do.

[20] (P397.S0)
[ 32b-d ] If you cannot strike with this defense, then you must go to another defense that can be made.

[21] (P398.S0)
[ 33a-a ] For thrusts and cuts, I want to make my defense, even if the sword is not taken from me in haste, nor if I am thrown to the ground from my horse. I will strike you with the pommel, if it does not do so.

[22] (P399.S0)
[ 33a-b ] Because you do not give me the pommel, I turn it, as my hand does not hold your blow with the sword or take it away.

[23] (P400.S0)
[ 33a-c ] Thus, as I have taken you, I will throw you down from the horse, and this I believe.

[24] (P401.S0)
[ 33a-d ] You wished to throw me off my horse, and with that, I must contend against you in this matter.

[25] (P402.S0)
[ 33b-a ] The stirrup with which I have to carry you, and for this, I must walk on the ground.

[26] (P403.S0)
[ 33b-b ] From horseback you wished to throw me down, as this with contrary intent you intended to land upon me.

[27] (P404.S0)
[ 33b-c ] You and your horse, I wish to throw the chest of my horse into the hindquarters of yours, and I will make it go. I do not wish to leave the morsel of your horse until you do not go to the ground. And when one is well-armed and stands in fine readiness, for with armor I cannot do him harm.

[28] (P405.S0)
[ 33b-d ] To take the reins from the hand of that horse, I wish to pull from the head of your horse, and when the reins are pulled from the head, I will lead you in another direction.

[29] (P406.S0)
[ 34b-a ] This master ties a rope to the saddle and to the foot of his lance, which is so cruel and fierce, to throw it around the neck of his enemy, just to drag him to the ground, so I tell you.

[30] (P408.S0)
[ 36b-a ] Here ends the flower of the art of arms, for in what manner one man may counter another. Made by the flower of Friuli, Master Benedetto, who has known it well, may he believe in his own truth.
