[1] (P182.S0)
[ 38r ] BOOK FOUR I have already said above that this present work cannot bring forth any ornament, now to show you the reason, brave readers, I am led to conclude that if you wish to judge carefully, none of you will be without saying that there are many things worthy of praise in one that would be blameworthy or incongruous in another. And who is he that, greatly praising the polished artful manner, the visage not ungracefully depicted of a fair lady, would not blame such things if he saw them in a young man? Many foolish words we still praise in a child, which if he were to retain in his mature years, he would be ridiculed by all for demonstrating them. The same thing can be praised and blamed, not for its own sake, but in regard to the one to whom it is joined. And truly, he who does not praise the beautiful colors of sweet eloquence, the learned connections of his well-composed words, and the so harmonizing sound, is outside the bounds of true understanding, and he who would also disparage that same eloquence where it were not suitable would be justly said to be foolish.

[2] (P182.S1)
Thus the wise writers, according to the conditions of the people in their works, introduce speech and response, for as it does not befit one already burdened with wisdom and years to adorn himself with youthful attire, nor to recount matters of love, so it would be unseemly for a soldier, stained with rust from the arms he always bears, to utter any elegance with that tongue, which has endured such thirst and the continuous hardships of war, and more often than not has been rendered satiated by the dust blown through the spacious air. If he were not such as the magnanimous Ajax, who in the contest for the arms of Achilles pronounced before the princes of all Greece against the crafty Ulysses, although Ajax showed the effects of a soldier and Ulysses those of an orator, therefore, the oration of Ulysses (if it were to be judged by persuasive colors) is superior to that of Ajax, rather like a Diana stripped of her beautiful adornments and Venus, beside the always naked yet beautiful Pales, goddess of the shepherds.

[3] (P182.S2)
Because to close the desire, that although I do not come before the eyes of men for the sake of praying, my speech shall not be so irregular throughout, that it cannot be matched except from the outside, at least beneath the adorned garments of many modern works, from those surrounded.

[4] (P182.S3)
But continuing with my fourth effort, I say that in this I will compose the art of the sword with edge and targe, or wide brocchero, which, being well learned, good players of the game sword will also be able to transfer, making it clear to them that at the end of the book two other games will be added, namely, that of two swords and of the sword alone; but returning to that of the sword and wide brocchero, or targe, I say that.

[5] (P183.S0)
CHAPTER ONE.

[6] (P183.S1)
And if being well positioned with the sword and by chance with the wide brocchero, having the left foot forward, and the arm of the brocchero well extended towards the enemy, and the sword held high in a long tail, you will gather the right foot close to the left.

[7] (P183.S2)
Then you will advance with the left foot without striking any blow.

[8] (P183.S3)
Because when your enemy finds himself so close, he must either force himself to thrust, or to flee backward; but let us suppose that he thrusts with the left foot forward, against such a thrust you will be able to make more counter-attacks.

[9] (P183.S4)
Therefore, I will pass with the right towards his left side, striking him at the same time with a reverse in the arm of the sword, so that the left leg follows the right from behind, and for your protection, you will quickly withdraw your right foot, positioning yourself in a high long tail as previously mentioned.

[10] (P183.S5)
(Or by throwing the left foot towards his weak parts, you will be able to strike the false under that, and by stepping with the right foot towards his left parts, you will wound his left leg with a thrust, so that the left foot follows the right from behind.)

[11] (P183.S6)
Then, by throwing back your right foot, you will make a half turn of the body, by which you will find yourself in the renowned guard.

[12] (P184.S0)
You can also advance with your right foot towards his left side, thrusting a point into his flank in such a way that the left foot follows behind the right.

[13] (P184.S1)
Then, by drawing back the aforementioned foot, you will firmly gather yourself easily into the aforementioned guard.

[14] (P185.S0)
You can also strike with the right somewhat forward towards his weaker parts, thrusting the false of your sword beneath his thrust from the accompanied brocchero.

[15] (P185.S1)
Then you will strike immediately the left leg of one in reverse, and for your protection, you will withdraw your right foot, bringing yourself into a guard position facing forward, and subsequently, you will settle into the guard as many times as mentioned above.

[16] (P186.S0)
You could also step forward strongly somewhat towards his weak parts, thrusting in that moment with the true edge of your sword.

[17] (P186.S1)
Then, wanting to deliver a reverse strike to the face, you will pull your right foot back.

[18] (P186.S2)
After you have thrust a point in the face guard for your defense, you will act in the aforementioned guard, and thus the opponents of the thrust are finished.

[19] (P187.S0)
And thus I intend to compose the counters that can be made against one who thrusts a strike to wound you with a right blow, provided that both of you find yourselves with the left foot forward in a high long stance.

[20] (P188.S0)
The filth of such a thrust you can deliver with a half downward strike from the hand of the sword, ensuring that the head is well protected by the buckler in such a way that the sword descends into the iron guard, and as he delivers the downward strike to wound your head, you will immediately step forward with your right foot and then gather yourself into a head guard, protecting yourself from it, and delivering a similar downward strike across his legs.

[21] (P188.S1)
Therefore, by withdrawing your right foot back, you will turn the hand of the sword, for which turning you will find yourself comfortably in a high long guard with your left foot forward.

[22] (P189.S0)
Now you will gather the weak foot against the strong, and at once you will advance your right foot, thrusting the true edge of your sword into such a point, and when he turns to strike your leg, you will immediately place your sword under your shield towards his right side, avoiding the aforementioned blow.

[23] (P189.S1)
Having done this, you will strike the right leg with a transverse reverse, and then you will withdraw your right foot back, simultaneously pushing forward a thrust until you are in the face guard for your defense, and you will position yourself in the aforementioned high long tail guard.

[24] (P189.S2)
You may also place your left foot behind the right, striking him with a straight thrust to the hand of the sword, which falls into a wide iron gate; and as he wishes to strike your head with the straight thrust, you will counter it with the false edge, advancing slightly with your right foot, and simultaneously delivering a reverse strike to his leg. Then, you will return the same foot backward, pushing a thrust under your buckler, which will go into a guard of the face for your protection, and you will settle into the aforementioned guard.

[25] (P190.S0)
You may also step with your right foot towards his left side, and with such a step, using the brocchero, thrust the point to parry, striking his leg with a direct blow, so that your left foot follows straight behind.

[26] (P190.S1)
[ 40v ] Then, by pulling back the right hand and turning the sword's blade into the aforementioned guard, you will find yourself.

[27] (P191.S0)
Either I will run with my right foot towards his strong parts, thrusting the true edge of your sword into his point, and immediately you will turn one reverse to his face, so that he cannot make the forehand; thus, drawing back your right foot, you will thrust him in the face, lifting yourself back with your whole body joyfully, and so you will return to the aforementioned guard.

[28] (P192.S0)
Then, while he thrusts, you shall strike him with the point, but without pushing it, with a false strike from below upwards into the guard of the face. And as he delivers the forehand strike, you should immediately step with your right foot towards his left side, striking his sword arm with a forehand blow, so that your weak foot follows the strong one behind for your protection, and turning the hand of the sword, you would find yourself in the aforementioned guard.

[29] (P193.S0)
CHAPTER TWO.

[30] (P193.S1)
If the enemy were to thrust and then place the left foot by the right, and subsequently bring the right foot forward to strike you with a straight thrust or a downward cut, you shall not move for the initial thrust. But as he comes with the straight thrust, you will intercept it by going into a high guard with your strong foot in the nanch and striking his leg with a following straight thrust while you draw back your right foot and turning your hand to the accustomed guard celebrated many times, you will act.

[31] (P194.S0)
[ 41r ] CHAPTER THREE.

[32] (P194.S1)
But if he thrusts a point at you with a reverse from above, either to the face or to the leg, you should keep your eye on the hand; as he delivers the aforementioned thrust, you will step forward with your right foot, evading it with a false step, and while he aims to strike you with the reverse to the head, you will step forward with your left foot, avoiding it with the true edge of your sword in such a way that the point guards well against the head.

[33] (P194.S2)
Then you will withdraw the hilt of the sword backward, thrusting it towards the face, and by leaping back, you will return to the aforementioned guard.

[34] (P194.S3)
And when he strikes the aforementioned reverse with his leg, you shall perceive before you the weaker foot, turning the true edge of the sword opposite to the reverse, in such a way that the tip of your sword points towards the ground, and then you shall thrust a stab at his face, leaping back, and in the end, you shall position yourself in the so-called guard.

[35] (P195.S0)
CHAPTER FOUR.

[36] (P195.S1)
Having said that, what can be done in high long guard, I likewise intend to speak of the offenses and counterattacks that can be made in narrow long guard with the right foot forward, and it should be clear that this is not the most secure guard for defense nor the most suitable for offense than this.

[37] (P195.S2)
Therefore, wanting to bind the enemy in this guard, you will draw back the left foot next to the right, and subsequently step forward with the right foot.

[38] (P195.S3)
For having it thus held, he will be compelled to choose one of two things by force, either to pull or to go backward, and if he loses any space of the field, it will be no small shame to him.

[39] (P196.S0)
Let us therefore suppose that he thrusts a point with his left foot forward to wound you, and it is within his power to strike you straight or with any other blow that he pleases. To secure yourself from such a thrust, by withdrawing your right foot back, you will go with the sword into the iron guard.

[40] (P196.S1)
And when he seeks to offend you with the forehand, or with another strike, you will immediately advance your right foot, parrying the blow with the false, and then you will follow by striking his right leg with a reverse, and then for your defense, you will thrust a point into his face beneath your buckler.

[41] (P196.S2)
Then, stepping back with a great stride of the right foot, you will turn the hand of the sword in such a way that the point faces the enemy, and then you will make another thrust in the same manner by leaping back with a joyful jump; and having done this, you will place yourself in the aforementioned guard of the long tail, tight, with the right foot forward.

[42] (P197.S0)
CHAPTER FIVE.

[43] (P197.S1)
When you find yourself in the aforementioned guard of the long, narrow tail with your right foot forward, if the enemy thrusts with his left foot forward to strike you with a straight thrust, you will parry that with the true edge, but while you see the straight thrust coming, you will thrust in turn to enter into the guard of the face, avoiding his attack.

[44] (P197.S2)
Then you will notice the weak foot towards its right side, giving it together with a reverse in the right line.

[45] (P197.S3)
Then, by thrusting a stroke to the face, you will withdraw backward with a leap and settle into the aforementioned tight long tail guard with your right foot forward.

[46] (P197.S4)
But assuming that after the thrust the enemy does not deliver the descending strike, but rather a reverse strike to the head, you shall advance your right foot, and with the true edge of your sword you shall deflect it, so that the head is well guarded from the blow.

[47] (P197.S5)
Then you will strike with your strong foot towards his left side, simultaneously delivering a forehand strike to his left thigh, so that the weak foot follows the strong from behind, and for your protection, you will gather the right foot back, turning the hand of the sword, so that you find yourself in a narrow long stance with the left foot forward.

[48] (P197.S6)
Then, retreating backward with two or three steps, you will advance with your right foot and position yourself in the aforementioned guard.

[49] (P198.S0)
But if by chance he does not indicate the head with that reverse.

[50] (P198.S1)
But if you wish to strike the leg, you will step forward with the left foot, and with the true edge of the sword you will strike, in such a way that the point faces toward the ground.

[51] (P198.S2)
Having done this, you will thrust at his side, leaping back with a jump; and if you do not wish to jump, it will be sufficient to step back three or four paces, so that you return to the aforementioned guard.

[52] (P199.S0)
CHAPTER SIX.

[53] (P199.S1)
If the enemy were to strike a downward blow to wound your head, you shall draw back your right foot, striking his sword arm with a downward blow, so that it falls into the iron guard and the [42v] brocchero secures your head well.

[54] (P199.S2)
Then you will draw back your left foot and turn the hand of the sword, for you will find yourself comfortably in the previously mentioned guard, the long tail tight, with your right foot forward.

[55] (P200.S0)
CHAPTER SEVEN.

[56] (P200.S1)
And when the enemy strikes a thrust, or a forehand, or a backhand, whichever of such blows you wish, you will make a false transversal with your sword arm in such a way that the head is well defended by the parry, not allowing the guard of the face to be penetrated.

[57] (P200.S2)
Then you shall set yourself in the renowned guard.

[58] (P200.S3)
And if by chance he strikes a forehand toward your right leg, you will immediately guide your weak foot towards his strong parts, simultaneously pushing the false edge of your sword under the guard, avoiding him.

[59] (P200.S4)
Then immediately you will deliver a thrust to his right leg, followed by a good thrust to the face, which as soon as you execute, will cause you to retreat gracefully with a gentle leap.

[60] (P200.S5)
Then, returning forward with the right, you will likewise position yourself in the opposing guard.

[61] (P201.S0)
CHAPTER EIGHT.

[62] (P201.S1)
As I find myself inspired by what can be done virtuously and masterfully in the aforementioned two guards, high long tail and narrow long tail with the right foot forward, I see two other guards in the aforementioned combat, in which it is necessary to make the Reader aware, since in many ways one can both offend and defend in these, namely, the iron door guard and the narrow iron door guard. Taking the first, I say that, finding oneself equipped with the aforementioned arms, sword with a sharp edge, and wide brocchero, or shield in the iron door guard, whoever can initiate the fight, but he who seeks to obtain victory by any means should not be the one who begins, but rather in the guard with subtle awareness remaining.

[63] (P201.S2)
And when the enemy thrusts a point with the right foot forward to strike you with a downward blow to the head, you shall oppose such a thrust with the false edge of the sword without moving your foot.

[64] (P201.S3)
And while he strikes the downward blow to the head, you, immediately stepping forward with your right foot, will bring your sword into the guard of the head, avoiding his strike, and with such a maneuver, you will wound him in the leg.

[65] (P201.S4)
Then for your safety, you will make the good brocchero a guard of the head.

[66] (P201.S5)
Subsequently, you will retreat your right foot, pushing it into a point in the guard of the face, and then you will move into the aforementioned guard that we have established in the field, namely the iron gate.

[67] (P201.S6)
But if he thrusts a point to wound your leg with a direct strike using the false, I will parry it.

[68] (P201.S7)
But if he were to strike such a blow at your leg, you, retreating backward with your weak foot, will strike his sword arm with a response of such a direct blow, and having done this, for your own safety, you will withdraw two or three steps, reestablishing yourself in the guard we have been discussing.

[69] (P201.S8)
And when he thrusts a point with the right foot forward to wound you in the head with a descending strike or a fendente, you will send that away with the false, but as you follow you will see the aforementioned strikes, you pulling back the left foot will join it in the arm of the sword with a half descending strike.

[70] (P201.S9)
Then, similarly drawing the left, you will act in the aforementioned guard.

[71] (P201.S10)
And if he were to thrust such a point forward with his right foot to strike you with a downward blow to the leg, you shall likewise nullify such a thrust with the false.

[72] (P201.S11)
But in the turning of the forehand, you will immediately step forward with your right foot towards his right side, placing the false edge of your sword beneath the aforementioned forehand, so that it accompanies the thrust, and you will strike him with a reverse cut to the thigh.

[73] (P201.S12)
Then, for your defense, you will retreat with your right foot backward, thrusting a stab to the face and lifting yourself backward with a jump.

[74] (P201.S13)
In which act, you shall act in the guard.

[75] (P201.S14)
But if by chance, after having pushed the point forward with the right, you wish to strike with a reverse to the face, you shall first damage that point with the false in such a way that the false does not pass beyond the guard of the face.

[76] (P201.S15)
And when he will turn the reverse for the head, you shall place your left foot a great step backward, then the right, making a good brocchero to evade the head.

[77] (P201.S16)
Then you will strike with a transverse forehand to the arm of the sword, then you will gather the strong foot back and set yourself in the aforementioned guard.

[78] (P201.S17)
And when after the thrust you wish to strike him in reverse to the leg, with the usual false you will strike, and then withdrawing your back foot you will not reach his sword arm with a half reverse, and subsequently you will pull your foot straight back, returning to the comfort of the guard as it is said.

[79] (P202.S0)
CHAPTER NINE.

[80] (P202.S1)
In this, we shall discuss the strikes that can be made when both of you find yourselves with the swords in a narrow iron gate.

[81] (P202.S2)
Therefore, wanting to bind the enemy, with the right foot forward you will gather the left.

[82] (P202.S3)
Then you will perceive the same right somewhat ahead.

[83] (P202.S4)
And if the enemy were to thrust at you with a point to strike you sharply with a forehand, or backhand, or downward strike to the head, you shall meet that thrust with the false, and as he steps forward with his right foot to deliver one of the aforementioned blows, you, withdrawing your right foot back, will strike him with a forehand across the blade of the sword.

[84] (P202.S5)
Then, similarly drawing back the left, you will act in your aforementioned guard, the narrow iron gate.

[85] (P202.S6)
But if he thrusts a point with the left foot forward to wound you in the opposing leg of a right strike, such a thrust (as has been said) you will nullify with the false.

[86] (P202.S7)
And while he passes with the right in order to strike you with the forehand, you, retreating with the strong foot, will deliver a similar blow to his inside arm, and for your safety, you will likewise draw back the left, returning to the taught guard.

[87] (P202.S8)
And if after the thrust you step forward with your left foot, he will strike with his right foot and damage your head with a downward or diagonal cut, you, stepping back with your right foot and lowering your sword in a guard position, will have thus avoided the thrust beforehand.

[88] (P202.S9)
But as he rushes to strike you with the forehand or the descending blow, you will step forward with your right foot, making a false transverse movement from below upwards against the enemy's sword, and immediately you will deliver a thrust to his leg, and then you will flee for your protection, stepping back with your right foot, pushing a point into his face beneath your buckler.

[89] (P202.S10)
Then, similarly returning the left foot back, you will position yourself in the renowned guard.

[90] (P202.S11)
And when after the thrust he wishes to advance with his left foot, intending to strike you with a downward blow to the leg with his right, you shall first parry such a thrust as usual with your false edge, and as he aims to reach you with the downward strike, you will immediately step forward with your left foot towards your right side, pushing the false edge of your sword under your buckler and thereby defending yourself from the aforementioned blow, and subsequently you will deliver a reverse strike to his leg, then you will thrust at his face and retreat with a leap, returning to the aforementioned guard.

[91] (P202.S12)
But if he were to thrust a point with the left foot forward to strike you with a reverse to the head, you would turn the false to parry it without moving your foot.

[92] (P203.S0)
And while he aims to strike you from the reverse, you will swiftly step forward with your left foot, and you will make a half turn of the sword's hilt, defending yourself from that, ensuring that the brocchero watches the head well, and immediately you will thrust the said brocchero into the enemy's sword, delivering a thrust to the face or to the chest, whichever you wish, and then you will leap back, regaining your position in the said guard.

[93] (P203.S1)
And if he were to thrust with the left foot forward to strike you with a reverse to the leg, in avoidance of such a thrust you shall step with the left foot towards his right side, delivering a false strike in such a way that it does not pass beyond the guard of the face.

[94] (P203.S2)
And when he will turn the aforementioned reverse for the leg, you will immediately step forward with your right foot, turning a half reverse from below upwards, in such a way that the point faces towards the ground, and thus you will have defended yourself.

[95] (P203.S3)
Then, with a transverse forehand, you will strike the arm of the sword, ensuring that the broccher protects the head well.

[96] (P203.S4)
Then, withdrawing your right foot back, you will go with the sword in the face guard, and subsequently, you will withdraw your left foot back, placing yourself in the aforementioned guard.

[97] (P204.S0)
CHAPTER TEN.

[98] (P204.S1)
Having provided all that can be masterfully done in the aforementioned four guards with the sword of the edge and the wide broadsword, or shield in hand, leaving aside many other strikes that do not possess such mastery to avoid lengthiness, of which I have nonetheless instituted a separate chapter, taking the beginning from the high long tail which was the first guard, and closing with the iron door, which is the fourth and last, I say therefore that

[99] (P205.S0)
From the high long tail with the left foot forward, you can thrust a point while feigning to strike him with a reverse to the head; nonetheless, you will reach his leg with a direct thrust.

[100] (P206.S0)
You can also thrust with the right foot forward, making it seem as if you are going to strike him with a downward cut to the head, but you will actually strike him from behind to the leg.

[101] (P207.S0)
You can also thrust with the right foot forward, and guiding the weak foot towards your strong parts, you will join the leg of a right strike, so that the head is well shielded from the opponent's weapon, and that the right foot follows the left from behind.

[102] (P208.S0)
Now I will deliver a thrust without moving my foot, and then I will gather my foot back near the right, which done, I will strike with the right forward while simultaneously delivering a straight thrust, or a downward cut, or an upward cut, as you wish.

[103] (P209.S0)
You can also deliver a half strike to the enemy's hand, and return with a reverse strike to the leg without moving your foot.

[104] (P209.S1)
Or you can strike from a false position upward through the hand of the sword without any movement.

[105] (P209.S2)
To thrust a strike overhand with the right foot forward, which falls into the wide iron gate, and from there you can make a false and a direct strike, and subsequently a false and a reverse strike. Moreover, you could also make a false advancing strike even into the guard of the face, and then, stepping forward with the left foot, you will make a half turn of the fist, thrusting a point into the face or into the chest, and this blow is singular against a left-handed opponent, for from any strike he delivers, you would be able to defend yourself.

[106] (P210.S0)
But if a left-handed man were to strike you with a leg, you must keep this regulated order, that is, step forward with your left foot, and turn the point of your sword towards the ground, thus avoiding his blow, and thrusting a stab into his face.

[107] (P210.S1)
And when the aforementioned left-handed person would strike you with a forehand, you shall wound him with the leading hand of a backhand, and if he were to strike with a backhand, likewise you shall harm him with the aforementioned hand of a forehand. Thus, these rules should be kept against left-handed individuals, always moving against his sword.

[108] (P210.S2)
Now following the combat with another who is not left-handed, you must beware that if he attempts to strike you with a forehand blow to the head, you will withdraw your left foot back, delivering a forehand strike to his sword hand.

[109] (P210.S3)
And if he strikes from the right to the leg, you shall gather your left foot back, striking his sword hand with a half cut.

[110] (P210.S4)
But when you find yourself with the enemy in the aforementioned high long tail guard with your left foot forward, you can deliver a thrust without moving your foot.

[111] (P210.S5)
Then bring the left foot back next to the right, so that the sword is extended behind, and immediately step forward with the right foot, thrusting another point above.

[112] (P210.S6)
You shall gather your right foot next to the left, and the sword under your arm, and immediately stepping forward with the weak foot, you will thrust a reverse point at his face, and then you will arch with the right foot towards his left side, striking his head with a downward cut or the opposite leg, and if it suits you better, you can do it in reverse.

[113] (P211.S0)
Cap.

[114] (P211.S1)
I'm sorry, but it seems you haven't provided the text you want translated. Please share the specific passage from the medieval Italian text, and I'll be happy to assist you with the translation.

[115] (P211.S2)
of the game of two swords.

[116] (P211.S3)
Because the play of two swords, one in each hand, is very useful and beautiful, in this chapter we shall compose various things that can be done masterfully in that.

[117] (P211.S4)
[ 46v ] Therefore, finding yourself at one end of the hall opposite your enemy and wishing to engage him in combat in such a way that you have your right foot somewhat forward of the left, and the sword of your right hand in a narrow iron guard, and that of your left in a high guard, you will first step with your right foot somewhat sideways towards your left side, and similarly slide with your left, making the sword of the right false and reversed, and that of the left false and direct, lowering the left sword into a narrow iron guard and keeping the right in a high guard, so that the right foot follows the left from behind.

[118] (P211.S5)
Then, stepping forward with the right foot, the sword of the left must make a false and reverse strike, and that of the right a false and direct strike, descending into the iron gate with the strong, just as with the weak you should place it in the head guard.

[119] (P211.S6)
Next, you will step with your right foot towards his weak parts, and then with the left foot forward, making a false and reverse action with the right hand while bringing the sword into the guard of the head, and with the left hand making false and true actions, positioning yourself in a narrow iron gate in such a way that the right leg follows the left, and thus you have completed the approach to the play, subjecting the strikes that are made in the play and the return to the initial place, as we did in the assaults of sword and brocchero in the second book.

[120] (P212.S0)
Now, when you have approached the enemy and wish to strike him, you will step forward with your right foot, thrusting a point at his face, and then pulling back with a reverse strike to the leg, so that the sword in your right hand falls into a narrow hanging guard, and that of your left hand goes into a high guard. Immediately, you will guide your left foot towards his right side, delivering a downward strike to his head with the sword of your weak hand, which will fall into a narrow iron gate, so that your right foot follows your left.

[121] (P212.S1)
Then you will thrust with both points forward, crossing the swords for your defense in such a way that the sword of the strong is above that of the weak.

[122] (P212.S2)
Then, with the right foot, you will step towards his right side, striking him with a downward blow to the head with the right sword in a narrow iron gate, and the left sword should be placed in the guard of the head, the left foot behind the right. From there, you will slide with the right foot towards his left side and then also with the left, and in such a movement, the right sword should make a false and reverse action, while the left should make a false and downward strike with the weak in a narrow iron gate, but with the strong in the guard of the head, ensuring that the following right leg is behind the left.

[123] (P212.S3)
Then, seeing the right foot forward, you shall thrust a point into the face with the sword of the right hand.

[124] (P212.S4)
Then, stepping with the left foot towards your right side, you will deliver a thrust across the right temple with the left sword, so that the right leg follows the left, and the sword of the same left hand drops into a narrow iron guard, while the right sword is in a face guard. Then you will step forward with the right foot, pushing a thrust to the face accompanied by a descending thrust in a narrow iron guard, and the weak sword will go into a head guard. Immediately after, you will also thrust to the face with the left hand, and with your left foot forward.

[125] (P212.S5)
Having done this, you will then pass with the right towards his weaker parts, striking him with the sword of the right a downward cut to the left temple, descending into the iron door, so that the left leg follows the right from behind, and that the sword of the left is found in the guard of the head.

[126] (P213.S0)
And if by chance the enemy wishes to respond to you with the sword of the right, striking you a downward blow to the head, you will parry that with the sword of the weak hand, and with the one of the right, you will thrust him in the chest.

[127] (P214.S0)
But if he responds in reverse, you will similarly make him go empty with the sword of the strong hand, and with that of the weak hand you will spoil his face with a forehand strike.

[128] (P214.S1)
And when the aforementioned response of his right strike is offered to you with the sword of the left, you shall deflect it with the true edge of the sword of the right hand, delivering a downward cut to his face with that of the left.

[129] (P215.S0)
Similarly, if the reverse from the enemy is drawn with the left hand, you must strike it with the true edge of the left, pushing a point into the face of the right sword, and then gathering the left foot close to the right, you will subsequently glide forward with the right, making a false and reverse with the right hand, and with the blade of the left, a half thrust down into the guard of the face.

[130] (P215.S1)
Then you will draw your right foot behind the left, and immediately you will thrust forward with the weak foot, pushing a point into his face with the sword of the left hand, and then guiding the right foot towards his left side, you will strike him on the head with a descending forehand in a narrow iron gate, in such a way that the left foot is that of the right follower, and that the sword of the left is found in the guard of the head.

[131] (P216.S0)
I provide the game, and wishing to return gracefully to the head of the hall from where you made the first play, you will draw back your right foot, making a false and reverse with the sword of the right hand, going into the guard of the head, and with that of the left, false and straight, descending into the narrow iron door.

[132] (P216.S1)
After withdrawing the left hand similarly backward with another step, you will make a false and direct strike with the left sword, rising with it into the head guard, and with the right, a false and direct strike in the iron door, descending.

[133] (P216.S2)
Then with another step you will gather back your right foot, making a false and reverse with the sword of the right in the high guard, and with that of the left a false and direct in the narrow descending iron gate, and thus you will have completed the beautiful return.

[134] (P217.S0)
Cap.

[135] (P217.S1)
xii.

[136] (P217.S2)
Of the art of the single sword.

[137] (P217.S3)
When you wish to fight against your enemy with the sword held by the edge alone, first you will set yourself with the right foot forward and with the sword in a tight iron guard, and without delivering any strike, you will bind him in this manner, that is, you will withdraw the left foot behind the right, and then you will thrust the right foot forward.

[138] (P217.S4)
When the enemy finds himself so close, he will either attack, wound, or flee backward; but if he thrusts a point, you will parry it with a false edge, turning it into a half-reverse to the thigh, and with your guard, you will deliver a false strike from below upwards to the hand of the sword, not piercing the guard in front, and finally, in the narrow iron gate guard, you will cut.

[139] (P218.S0)
But if he were to thrust a point at your face in order to harm you with a straight thrust or a reverse, you will counter it with the false, and when he strikes the straight thrust at your head, you will go with your sword in the guard of the head, avoiding it, and with such a blow, you will strike him either at the head or at the leg, as you wish.

[140] (P219.S0)
If by chance you wish to strike from below, or from the right, aim for the leg.

[141] (P219.S1)
In opposition to the forehand, you shall draw back the right foot, delivering a half forehand strike with the hand of the sword.

[142] (P219.S2)
But wanting to deliver a false counter, you will retreat backward with the aforementioned foot, striking his sword arm with a half counter, and finally in the said tight iron guard, you will act.

[143] (P220.S0)
And when he thrusts a point to strike you with a reverse to the head, or to the leg, but let us say to the head, you will nullify that with the false edge of the sword without moving your foot, and against the incoming reverse you will step forward with your left foot making a half turn of the fist, thus defending yourself from it.

[144] (P220.S1)
Then immediately, striking with the right towards his weaker parts, you will give him a downward blow to the head or to the leg, whichever you wish; having done this, the weak leg must follow the strong one.

[145] (P220.S2)
And if such a reverse thrust were aimed at your leg, you (stepping forward with your left foot) would turn the point towards the ground, delivering a thrust to the side, and immediately lifting yourself with a jump backward, where in the end you would place yourself in the already mentioned tight iron guard.

[146] (P220.S3)
But if you see coming from above a downward strike, or a reverse, or a slicing cut, or a thrust, you can powerfully evade any of these with the false, as long as you do not break the guard of the face.

[147] (P220.S4)
Then immediately with the foot forward you will strike, making a turn of the fist.

[148] (P220.S5)
Having done this, you will thrust a point into his face, or into the chest, as you wish; you can also, after having parried with the aforementioned false guard, strike him with one hand straight to the face, allowing it to run down the arms and chest, advancing somewhat forward with the right foot as much as you desire for such a blow; and this is one of the singular defenses that can be made in this art.
