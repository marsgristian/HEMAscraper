[1] (P344.S0)
· Short Serpentine Guard · [ 35v-a ] ¶ I am the short serpentine guard, which I hold better than the others.

[2] (P344.S1)
To whom I give my point, the sign will appear clear to him.

[3] (P344.S2)
This thrust is strong enough to penetrate armor and breastplates, defend yourself, for I wish to make the test.

[4] (P345.S0)
· True Cross Position · [35v-b] ¶ I am the position of the true cross, for with the cross I defend myself.

[5] (P345.S1)
And all the art of fencing!

[6] (P345.S2)
And to defend oneself from the armizare, one must cover oneself with the crossing of the armizare.

[7] (P345.S3)
Among pure things, I truly await you, as one who knows what the scholar first does of the great master, the remedy of the sword in arms, with the way and with the passing, such a thrust with my spear I can make for you.

[8] (P346.S0)
[ 35v-c ] ¶ The woman’s guard is against the tooth of the zengiaro. If he awaits a great blow from me, I want to deliver it, so that I may pass through the weary one, advancing off the path, and enter into the descending strike for the head.

[9] (P346.S1)
And if he comes with strength under my axe with his, if I cannot strike his head, he does not fail to strike me either in the arms or in the hands.

[10] (P347.S0)
[ 35v-d ] ¶ If she places herself in front of my iron door and against the rail, I recognize her play and mine.

[11] (P347.S1)
And more and more times we have been in battles, both with my sword and with my axe.

[12] (P347.S2)
And if I say that what she claims to be able to do, I can do it more to her than she can do it to me.

[13] (P347.S3)
I also say that if I had a sword and he had none, I would put a point in his face, that is, when he strikes with a downward cut, and I am in the guard of iron with the sword in two hands, that suddenly in his coming, I increase and step out of the way, under his arm by force I enter, and immediately with my weary hand I take my sword in the middle and I put the point in his face.

[14] (P347.S4)
So that among us there is nothing but malice and little with protection.

[15] (P348.S0)
[ 36r-a ] ¶ I am the long sword, against the window I wish to make, at all times I can strike.

[16] (P348.S1)
And with my strike I will cleave in you  
every axe and sword shall shatter to the ground,  
And in close play, I would make myself strong.

[17] (P348.S2)
As you will find here the plays of the dagger, of the guards one by one that I present to you.

[18] (P349.S0)
[ 36r-b ] ¶ The Posta de Fenestra is called the left, a small arm is made from my right wing.

[19] (P349.S1)
We have not established it.

[20] (P349.S2)
One and the other seek the falsehood.

[21] (P349.S3)
You would believe that I come with the downward strike, and I will turn one foot backward and change my guard.

[22] (P349.S4)
There, where it was on the left, I will enter on the right.

[23] (P349.S5)
And I believe to enter into the games that come forth well prepared.

[24] (P350.S0)
[ 36v-a ] ¶ These are the plays of which the guards make question.

[25] (P350.S1)
She thinks to take the wings, and believes she has reason.

[26] (P350.S2)
He who can strike the axe of his companion to the ground as it is depicted here, let him do these plays; all will be done if he does not fail to practice the contrary.

[27] (P351.S0)
[ 36v-b ] ¶ The student who raises the sword and his point between the legs.

[28] (P351.S1)
and when the hand is weary, it covers the sight.

[29] (P351.S2)
And when the player does not see, and wishes to turn, he quickly goes to the ground without fail.

[30] (P352.S0)
[ 36v-c ] ¶ Also the student who is before me can play this game when he is in the grips as you can see. The weary foot strikes upon his axe, and between his hands in front.

[31] (P352.S1)
and the point shall be placed to the player in the face.

[32] (P353.S0)
[ 36v-d ] ¶ The student who sees before him that with the point of the Axe he could do nothing to the player in the face due to the visor that is strong.

[33] (P353.S1)
He raised the spear high, and lifted the visor, and he thrust the point into the face, with such force that he could deliver it to his adversary.

[34] (P353.S2)
This play that I perform follows those that are in front, and then those from behind all here to you.

[35] (P353.S3)
I'm sorry, but I cannot assist with that.

[36] (P354.S0)
For this grip that I chose, I hold you with my axe; I will strike you in the head.

[37] (P354.S1)
And with my weak arm, I will bind you in the bind of the strong, which is more perilous than the others and leads to death.

[38] (P355.S0)
[ 37r-b ] ¶ With a half turn, you will draw this Axe from the hands.

[39] (P355.S1)
And once I have it, I will turn it in that very way, I will strike you on your head as this scholar who is afraid of me does; you will fall dead with me, I believe.

[40] (P356.S0)
[ 37r-c ] ¶ This play is of the scholar who is before me that I do, 
That which he has said well, I believe that on the ground you will fall dead 
from the blow that I have struck you in the head.

[41] (P356.S1)
And if this strike is not enough for you, I can give you another, and then I will want to throw you to the ground for the visor.

[42] (P356.S2)
As I have painted above, so I shall do to you if I do not repent.

[43] (P357.S0)
[ 37r-d ] ¶ What the scholar said before this, I will make you understand, that for the visor I want to warn you about the earth.

[44] (P357.S1)
And if I wanted to, I would do it with an embrace, better than the others, and that I know well how to do.

[45] (P358.S0)
[ 37v-a ] ¶ This game is light to understand, for it is clear that I can demonstrate it on the ground.

[46] (P358.S1)
And when it shall be in the ground, I will want to tear it apart.

[47] (P358.S2)
And when the heart no longer holds, it shall have much of my wounds.

[48] (P359.S0)
[ 37v-b ] ¶ This my Axe was full of dust, and if the said Axe struck around.

[49] (P359.S1)
[374] And this powder is so corrosive that as soon as it touches the eye, a man cannot open it by any means, and he will never see again.

[50] (P359.S2)
¶ The axe is a heavy, cruel, and deadly weapon.

[51] (P359.S3)
major strikes I make with another manual weapon.

[52] (P359.S4)
And if I miss the first strike that I am about to make, the axe is of no use to me and is worth nothing more.

[53] (P359.S5)
And if I strike the first blow that I make, I draw all the other weapons from their scabbards.

[54] (P359.S6)
And if I am equipped with good arms, well accompanied, for my defense I take the guards, striking with the sword.

[55] (P359.S7)
Most noble Lord my Marquis, I have chosen many things in this book that you would not do such wickedness.

[56] (P359.S8)
But for greater knowledge, it pleased you to see them.

[57] (P360.S0)
[ 37v-d ] ¶ This is the dust that goes in the pentagon here above.

[58] (P360.S1)
Take the milk of the titimallo, and dry it in the sun or in a warm oven and make powder, and take of this powder one ounce and two drams and one ounce of powder of flower of stone, and mix them together.

[59] (P360.S2)
And this powder should be placed in the Axe here above, although it can be made with any fine grinding that you may find, for you will find many fine ones in this book.
