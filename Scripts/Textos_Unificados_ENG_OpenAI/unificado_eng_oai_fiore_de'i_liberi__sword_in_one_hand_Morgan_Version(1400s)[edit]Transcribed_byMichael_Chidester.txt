[1] (P224.S0)
[ 17v-a ] We are three players who wish to strike this master.

[2] (P224.S1)
One wishes to thrust with the point, the other to cut; the other wishes to launch his sword against the said master.

[3] (P224.S2)
So it will be a great deed that he is not dead, this master.

[4] (P224.S3)
May God make him not sad.

[5] (P225.S0)
[ 19r-a ] This is a play that wishes to be armed for those who want to place such a thrust.

[6] (P225.S1)
When one thrusts at you with the point, or with a cut, you make the cover, and immediately place this as it is depicted.

[7] (P227.S0)
[ 17v-d ] In all that I have found uncovered, and in the head I have surely struck you.

[8] (P227.S1)
And if I with my foot forward wish to pass, I could make many tight plays against you, such as in bindings, breaks, and in embraces.

[9] (P228.S0)
[ 17v-c ] What the master has said, I have done well, that is, I went off the path making good cover.

[10] (P228.S1)
And the player I found uncovered.

[11] (P228.S2)
So that I want to place a point in the face for certain.

[12] (P228.S3)
And with the hand that does not tire, I wish to prove.

[13] (P228.S4)
If I can make your sword go to the ground.
