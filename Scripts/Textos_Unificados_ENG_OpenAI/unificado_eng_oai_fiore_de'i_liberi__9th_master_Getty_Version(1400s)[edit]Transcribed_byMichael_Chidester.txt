[1] (P203.S0)
[ 17v-c ] ¶ The Ninth King is, and more so is the dagger, and such a grip that I make from below, such a grip does the Fourth King of the wise hand that I make from underneath.

[2] (P203.S1)
But my games are not made with my own little ones.

[3] (P203.S2)
This grip is worth in arms and without that I can make many strong plays.

[4] (P203.S3)
And greatly those who follow me.

[5] (P203.S4)
In arms and without them, there is no doubt.

[6] (P204.S0)
[ 17v-d ] ¶ My Master Nono, with the grip he has made, I have followed. Leaving my right hand from the grip, I took your dagger as I do, and I will turn it against your elbow.

[7] (P204.S1)
The point I will place upon your face for certain.

[8] (P204.S2)
According to how the scholar makes me understand.

[9] (P204.S3)
In that way, I will do as I believe.

[10] (P205.S0)
[ 18r-a ] ¶ This game that the scholar before me plays, I complete for him, so that his game may end with his grasp here.

[11] (P205.S1)
Although the others may teach the art of such grips, other games will be made.

[12] (P205.S2)
Look straight ahead and you will see their ways.

[13] (P206.S0)
[ 18r-b ] ¶ The grip of my Master, that I have made known.

[14] (P206.S1)
And my right hand I left from its hold.

[15] (P206.S2)
And if I have taken you under your right elbow, To dislocate your arm.

[16] (P206.S3)
And with such a grip, I can also put you in a bind, or in a strong key.

[17] (P206.S4)
That the third King and master may reign over his games.

[18] (P206.S5)
In the Sixth play are his ways.

[19] (P207.S0)
[ 18r-c ] ¶ For the capture of my master, I have come into this.

[20] (P207.S1)
And of this grip, I will leave you no rest, for I will bind you in a strong lock beneath.

[21] (P207.S2)
That I care little for quarrels.

[22] (P207.S3)
Although your dagger may well have it without effort.

[23] (P208.S0)
[ 18r-d ] ¶ The grasp of my master is not abandoned.

[24] (P208.S1)
Also, I immediately entered under his right arm to dislocate it with such a grip.

[25] (P208.S2)
The armed or the unarmed, this would do for him.

[26] (P208.S3)
And when I hold him close to me in my care, for wrongdoing I will not show him courtesy.

[27] (P209.S0)
[ 18v-a ] ¶ I did not abandon the grip of my master until I saw this player who did not let go of the grip.

[28] (P209.S1)
And he bows with the dagger towards the ground,  
And I immediately took his hand with my hand  
To weaken his legs.

[29] (P209.S2)
And when his hand was well secured, I passed over him.

[30] (P209.S3)
As you can see, one cannot dismount without falling.

[31] (P209.S4)
And this play that I have shown I can perform.

[32] (P209.S5)
The right hand of the dagger is loose, and through the foot I come to take it, to make it entirely go to the ground, and to take away the dagger cannot fail me.

[33] (P210.S0)
[ 18v-b ] ¶ This scholar who is before me has made the beginning.

[34] (P210.S1)
And I make the end of his play, to send him to the ground as he has well said.

[35] (P210.S2)
For this game has not run in the art, we wish to show that we have parts in all of it.

[36] (P211.S0)
[ 18v-c ] ¶ My master made his cover and immediately with my weary hand, I took his in this manner.

[37] (P211.S1)
And with my dagger, I make a thrust into his chest.

[38] (P211.S2)
And if my dagger were not sufficient, I would perform this play that follows for me.

[39] (P212.S0)
[ 18v-d ] ¶ This game is fulfilled by this scholar who shows me that he leaves his wretched dagger and desires your good one.

[40] (P212.S1)
This that I do for you, you reason it to him.

[41] (P213.S0)
[ 18v-f ] ¶ The contrary of the Ninth Master is this: when the player has taken the right hand with the dagger with his tired hand, then immediately the player should take his dagger near the point and pull it or thrust it in such a way that it forces him to let go, or the dagger strikes the elbow to make him disarm.
