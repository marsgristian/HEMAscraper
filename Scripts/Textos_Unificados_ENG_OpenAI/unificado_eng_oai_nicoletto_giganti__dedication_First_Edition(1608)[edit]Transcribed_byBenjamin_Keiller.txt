[1] (P105.S0)
[ Ttl ] SECOND BOOK,  
OF NICCOLETTO GIGANTI OF VENICE,  
Master of Arms of the most illustrious Lords Knights of the Sacred Religion of Saint  
STEPHEN.

[2] (P106.S0)
[ i ] VERY ILLUSTRIOUS, AND VERY REVEREND LORD COMMANDER MY MOST ESTEEMED PATRON.

[3] (P106.S1)
If by universal consent those who are deemed worthy of dishonor and punishment are the despisers of the laws made by men, how much more should the obstinate and transgressors of the laws of nature be abhorred and punished, since these are not by human knowledge or power inscribed on paper or written on tablets, but by Her very self, with praiseworthy characters of love sweetly impressed in the hearts of Her children. Among many of these deserving inviolable observance, it seems to me that the one which should be kept and observed is that which is called the law of gratitude, so as not to take away from benefactors the glory that they rightly earned by doing good. This has made me understand that just as I must infinitely owe to Your Excellency.

[4] (P106.S2)
For the noted courtesies and favors that I receive from You daily, since I am unable to repay them in kind, I at least render my thanks, which I shall do at all times and in every place, to the displeasure of fortune; for although she has been able to make me scarce of resources, she cannot deprive me of that virtue which I have earned over many years and with much effort, from which I have great convenience through the Prints to make known to the World how much I owe to Your Excellency.

[5] (P106.S3)
And especially the present Book of Arms will give clear testimony of this, in the humility and obscurity of my state composed, and by the sweet force of the law of gratitude under the glorious name of You, my singular benefactor brought to light, take it then as something rightly due to You, and as I have greatly gained by acquiring the service of Your Excellency.

[6] (P106.S4)
Thus, through that from the Book, I shall no longer say mine, but his, let the World learn the art of defending oneself, and from Your Excellency.

[7] (P106.S5)
Take the example of rising to glory with the wings of courtesy and nobility.

[8] (P106.S6)
And humbly making reverence to the Most High, I remain praying for greater grace.
