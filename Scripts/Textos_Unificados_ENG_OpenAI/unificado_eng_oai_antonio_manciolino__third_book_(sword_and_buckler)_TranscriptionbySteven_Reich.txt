[1] (P109.S0)
[30r] THIRD BOOK It is said that more than our fencers, the assaults are fortunate those in the rough papers, which the disheveled satyrs make to the victorious nymphs.

[2] (P109.S1)
Therefore, such delicacies seem to the writers the matter, that from themselves their sweet words are composed under a continuous and dulcet style, while the woolly limbs of the half-goat deities, with their horned foreheads, or their languid movements, or their simple and rustic ambushes are arranged, not by writing, but by depicting, showing the troubled goddesses in the long course, some raising their purple garments above the white knee with the golden locks of their fallen hair cascading over soft shoulders, or with those scattered and gently wafted by a sweet breeze, others cast into the clearest and flowing rivers, thus considering the assailants of their virginities consecrated to Diana, fleeing, and some, overcome by great lassitude, standing behind thick hidden thickets, such as in the sight of which we often see the morning roses appearing at the sun's rise, and those, drenched in trickling sweat, longing with the delicate fingers of their very white hands to render themselves dry.

[3] (P109.S2)
But since the subject is not one of true grace proposed to me, …

[4] (P110.S0)
...to the discerning readers, I deserve forgiveness for this, as I bring forth nothing but straight thrusts, reverses, false strikes, points, and similar terms which (wanting to be understood in the art) cannot be changed into other names, as the meaning of passing, which continually runs through my writing pen, while it so often happens to say that the player passes with the left or with the right foot, although I might say, to pass, to cross, to advance, to glide, to perceive, to guide, or to lead the foot, and where it says right, we sometimes say in its place straight, or strong, or valid, because a man has more strength in the right side than in the left by nature, and likewise, when left, when weak, or feeble, to avoid the tedious regret, there being nothing more odious than the frequent repetition of the same word...

[5] (P111.S0)
...for these reasons, although it is clear to me that I shall have difficulty pleasing those whose refined ears are accustomed only to the sweet and sorrowful songs of Philomena, nonetheless, if they have the strength of a man, they should at least read this work for the profit, as they lack no other adorned styles.

[6] (P111.S1)
Claro! Por favor, forneça o texto que você gostaria que eu traduzisse.

[7] (P112.S0)
...Therefore, continuing with my purpose, I say that in this third book we shall teach the art of playing at half-sword.

[8] (P112.S1)
Therefore, when you often engage with the enemy, you must bring them to such close quarters that they are compelled to fight with half-sword, but not without great cunning and skill.

[9] (P112.S2)
However, among all others, this holds the principality, and he who does not have perfect knowledge of it and an excellent foundation, in no way can be a good master. And even if it happens that he is a good player or defender of himself due to the swiftness of his hands, he will not know how to teach others the true art, which consists in standing very strong. And it has already been said that such ones should not be called learned, but rather fortunate, even if they strike someone. And it must be clear that this entire third book will be divided not into Chapters, but into the offenses and their oppositions, so that the game is understood of sword and small broadsword.

[10] (P113.S0)
When you find yourself in close quarters with your enemy at half-sword, and wishing to take action, you must be very quick with your hands more than in any other play, for if you are sluggish, you will always be the one to suffer. Furthermore, it must be known that you can find yourself with the enemy in this play in no more than two ways: either edge to edge, so that your swords guard with the points facing each other, or false to false, so that your swords' right sides face each other with the points. And thus, different strikes arise for offense and defense from one manner, and others from the other.

[11] (P113.S1)
But taking a beginning from that, which can be done by finding false with false, I say that.

[12] (P114.S0)
[ 31v ] Being in the aforementioned manner with the enemy such that both of you strike with the false edges of your swords, and you with your right foot forward, you will act if you turn your false edge to make a thrust across his left temple, and immediately for your protection, having done this, you should withdraw backward with the same strong foot, or right as you wish to say, delivering a reverse strike to his right temple.

[13] (P115.S0)
The opposite of this grip will be for him who wishes to defend himself, for while he is turned with the false in the act of thrusting as previously mentioned, you will immediately advance with your weaker foot or whichever you prefer to call it, towards his right side, and you will strike him with an upward thrust to the right temple.

[14] (P116.S0)
And if it does not come to pass that you offend him in the aforementioned manner, while standing in half-sword, you shall strike him with your right foot in the belly, and that same foot, immediately returning back, you shall then deliver a downward strike to his head.

[15] (P117.S0)
The opposite of this offense is that while he intends to strike you with the kick, you will immediately strike the shin of the attacking leg with your brocchero, so that his design will not come to fruition.

[16] (P118.S0)
The third way to attack will be that, finding yourself with your left foot forward, you will thrust toward his weaker parts with your right foot, feigning to strike him with an overhead cut to the head; nonetheless, in such a manner, you will let your sword fall to the ground behind you, and immediately, stepping with your left foot toward his right side, you will thrust your head under his right armpit and your right hand inside his thighs, and lifting him from the ground, you will make him fall backward over your shoulders.

[17] (P119.S0)
The opposite of the renowned grip and offense is that while he makes the semblance of striking you with the forehand, you shall make no true response to such semblance.

[18] (P119.S1)
But as he lets his sword fall to place his head under your guard, by stepping back with your right foot, you will strike him in the neck with a reverse.

[19] (P120.S0)
The fourth way to attack will be that, having the right foot forward, you will make a feint to strike his left temple with a forehand, but in such a manner you will let the sword turn like a little wheel, and immediately passing with the left foot towards his right side, you will strike him with a backhand to his right temple.

[20] (P121.S0)
The opposite of this is that as he makes a strike from the right, you will close the hand of the sword with that of the buckler together, and in the passing, as he makes with the left foot to strike you with a reverse, you will immediately pull the left leg behind the right and deliver a half strike to his left temple in the manner of a guard facing him, which, by doing so, his reverse will not be able to harm you.

[21] (P122.S0)
The fifth way to strike will be, having the aforementioned right foot forward, you will place your hand on the sword from underneath, inside his sword hand, pressing downwards, so that you may thrust the false edge into his neck.

[22] (P122.S1)
The opposite of such an offense is that while the enemy wishes to place his hand in the shown manner, you with your hand will push his sword arm towards his left side, and thus he will not achieve his intent.

[23] (P123.S0)
[ 32v ] The sixth way is that, finding yourself with the aforementioned foot forward, you can step with your left foot towards his right side, striking him with your hand of the brocchero outside of the hand of his sword, and subsequently with a reverse strike to the neck, or to the head.

[24] (P124.S0)
The opposite of this sixth method is that while he advances his left foot to strike you with the hand of the brocchero, you will immediately strike him with the edge of your brocchero in the coming arm.

[25] (P125.S0)
The seventh ambush, still with the said foot forward, is that you can advance with a great step with your left foot towards his right side, striking him with an upward thrust from below, and then immediately passing with your right foot towards his left side, you will deliver a straight blow in the manner of a descending strike, ensuring that your left leg follows the right from behind.

[26] (P126.S0)
The opposite of this seventh way is that while he advances with his left foot to strike you with the aforementioned reverse, you will go into a guard of the face with the buckler under the hand of the sword, so that the hand is touched and covered by the buckler, and as he will turn the right hand in a downward manner, you will immediately, by throwing your right foot back, deliver a half diagonal strike to his sword hand.

[27] (P127.S0)
The eighth manner is that, having the left foot forward, you will slide with the right towards his left side, drawing back your sword beneath his, and at the same time you will place your buckler under his sword hand, wounding him with the false edge on the lesser side of the neck.

[28] (P127.S1)
Then, letting the left leg go behind the right, you will act with the sword in a face guard, and afterwards, withdrawing the right foot back, you will strike him on the temple with a thrust.

[29] (P128.S0)
The opposite of the aforementioned is that when the enemy draws the sword back beneath yours, you should immediately withdraw your right foot back, positioning yourself in the guard of the face.

[30] (P129.S0)
The ninth way to offend is indeed with the left foot forward, where you can advance with your right foot, feigning to strike the enemy in the head with a downward cut. In this feint, you will perform the Perugian act, that is, by throwing your sword and the buckler away from you, you will seize him with both arms, and having thus firmly grasped him without releasing your hold, you will let yourself fall seated. Then, from this position, you will strike him forcefully in the belly with both feet, causing him to find himself behind your shoulders, thrown off balance.

[31] (P130.S0)
The opposite of the aforementioned offense is that while he draws back with the right foot to make the semblance of the forehand, you, being cautious, will have your eye well on his hands for the sake of the grip, and when you see him drop the sword and the buckler, you will immediately withdraw your right foot back and strike his head with a reverse blow.

[32] (P131.S0)
The tenth way to offend with the left foot forward is that you can step with your right foot towards his right side, striking his sword with a strong forehand, and then, stepping towards the same right side with your left foot, you will deliver a backhand strike to his neck, ensuring that the right foot follows the left.

[33] (P132.S0)
The contrary will be that when he steps forward strongly as mentioned above to strike you with a forehand in the sword, you will strike him with your sword, anticipating that; but as he passes to wound you with a backhand, at that moment you will turn to face him with a half forehand.

[34] (P133.S0)
The eleventh way to offend is that, finding yourself with the weak foot forward, you will step with the strong foot towards his weak parts; and in this passing, you will feign to strike him with a downward cut, but instead you will strike his thigh with a beautiful reverse, and you will remain exposed from the upper parts to provoke the enemy to attack those. But as he would wish to do so, you, gliding with the sword in the guard of the head, will evade him, and then with the hand of the dagger, you will take his sword from the inside of yours, delivering a downward strike to his head, or a thrust to his face.

[35] (P134.S0)
The opposite of this evening, that as soon as he has passed to make the strike of the forehand, you shall not make any movement for that, but as he wishes to strike you from the reverse to the thigh, you will turn the sword with the point towards the ground, thus protecting yourself from it, and responding with a downward cut to the head.

[36] (P135.S0)
The twelfth way to attack shall be, that finding yourself with the right foot forward, you can strike him with a downward blow to the head, and if he is a good player, he will parry that, for immediately you making a feint with the downward blow to give him a reverse, through all this you will strike him with the same downward blow.

[37] (P136.S0)
The opposite of this is that when he wishes to strike you on the head with the forehand, you shall deliver a rising strike from below, which will go into the head guard, avoiding his forehand.

[38] (P136.S1)
Then immediately with your hand on the brocchero, you will press down his sword, wounding him in the upper parts, where it will seem better to you than a reversal.

[39] (P137.S0)
The thirteenth method would be that, finding yourself with the right foot forward, you will make a feint to strike him with a downward blow to the head; nonetheless, you will deliver a reverse strike in the act of a thrusting motion.

[40] (P138.S0)
Its opposite is that he will make the aforementioned thrust, you for your part will not make a move, but in the drawing of the reverse you will gather your right foot back, and the sword in the guard of the face.

[41] (P139.S0)
The fourteenth method is that, having the same right foot forward, you will step forward with the left, and with the sword, you will make a half turn of the fist, pushing a point into the face in the same turning motion.

[42] (P140.S0)
The opposite of this is that in the passing that he will make with the weak foot, you, quickly turning the strong foot back, will act in a high long tail.

[43] (P141.S0)
The fifteenth offense is that, with the aforementioned foot forward, you will make a semblance of striking his head with a descending blow, and while the enemy, out of fear, moves to evade it, you will deliver a reverse strike to his thigh, positioning yourself in a guard facing him.

[44] (P142.S0)
His opposite will be that in the view of the enemy displayed, you shall not make a move, but when he wishes to strike your thigh with a reverse, you, pulling your right foot back, will deliver one of your reverses to his sword arm.

[45] (P143.S0)
[ 34v ] The .xvi.

[46] (P143.S1)
In an offensive manner, it is only with the right hand forward that you can signal to strike him with a reverse to the head, then follow through with a straight thrust to the side, while positioning yourself in the guard of the face.

[47] (P144.S0)
Let it be the opposite, that at the signal the enemy makes for the reverse, you shall pull back your right foot, and when he thinks to strike you with a forehand to the side, you shall spoil his sword hand with a half forehand from the hilt accompanied.

[48] (P145.S0)
The .xvij.

[49] (P145.S1)
The manner is that, finding yourself with the right foot forward, you will place the brocchero under the enemy's sword, and at the same time, stepping with the left foot towards his right side, you will strike him with a mandritto across the right thigh, so that the strong foot follows the weak.

[50] (P146.S0)
The contrary is that when he wishes to subject his brocchero to your sword, you immediately withdrawing your right foot back will strike him with a forehand in the hand of the sword from the brocchero accompanied.

[51] (P147.S0)
Having already written what can be done in the grapples of half-swording, false against false, we now proceed to the second manner, that is, if the blades should meet edge to edge, we must add what can be done for and against, while observing the prescribed order, which has already been stated above: there are no other ways to strike in half-swording except for these two.

[52] (P148.S0)
Therefore, when the swords are with the straight edge facing each other, and you wish to be the agent and initiator, while your right foot is forward, you will advance with the left towards his right side, delivering a backhand strike to the right temple, pushing so that the right foot follows the left from behind.

[53] (P149.S0)
The opposite of this first manner will be, that while he aims to strike you with a reverse, you will turn one half mandritto to the head that rises up into the guard of the face.

[54] (P150.S0)
The second way to strike will be, that while you are with your right foot forward, you will thrust with your left towards his right side, delivering a reverse strike from below upwards, against his sword arm, and immediately you will withdraw your left foot back, delivering at the same time a straight strike to his face.

[55] (P151.S0)
The opposite of this is that when he comes to strike you with a reverse, you, placing your sword under his, will be defended; but while he withdraws his left hand to wound you with a forehand, you will strike him on the right temple with a transversal reverse.

[56] (P152.S0)
The third way is that, having the right foot forward as in any of the below-mentioned offenses.

[57] (P152.S1)
We shall not repeat this to avoid tedium; you will strike him with a reverse blow to his right temple, and if the enemy defends against this, you will immediately, with the rising or guard, as you wish to call it, strike with your sword against the enemy from the outside, delivering a cut to the head.

[58] (P153.S0)
His opposite will be that while he will turn the aforementioned reverse, you will evade it with the true edge of your sword, and as he wishes to strike your sword with the false edge, you will immediately raise yours up, so that his blow will go wide, and in this moment you will deliver a reverse strike to his head.

[59] (P154.S0)
[ 35v ] The fourth way to offend, which you can show him by making a reverse strike, and immediately stepping with your left foot towards his right side, you will turn the pommel of your sword over the knot of the enemy's hand from the outside, and you will press it down in such a manner that you can strike his head with a reverse blow.

[60] (P155.S0)
The opposite of this is that in the view that he will make to give you a reverse, you shall not make any movement, but as he will turn with the pommel, you shall immediately place your dagger under his sword and strike his right thigh with a transverse reverse.

[61] (P156.S0)
Fifth manner of offense, which you can execute by guiding the left foot towards his left side, feigning to strike him with a reverse, and thus you will return with the left foot back, delivering a downward strike to his head.

[62] (P157.S0)
The opposite will be, that when he makes a strike from above, you shall not move, but as he intends to deliver the downward cut to the head, you will immediately execute a strike from below upwards, which shall end in the guard of the head.

[63] (P158.S0)
The sixth way to offend shall be that you will step forward with your left foot in a great stride towards his left side, and striking him with a reverse from below upwards along his sword arm, you will subsequently make a grip, that is, you feigning to strike him with the brocchero to the face, and while he, in fear, moves his head, you will immediately thrust your brocchero arm inside his sword arm, lifting it with great tightness under your left armpit.

[64] (P158.S1)
Then, by withdrawing your right foot behind the left, you will ensure that he cannot offend you with the brocchero.

[65] (P159.S0)
The opposite of this evening, when he will guide his left foot in the manner described to strike you with the thrust, you will push your hand of the sword well forward from the overlaid cover, and in the semblance that he will make to strike you with the thrust to the face, you will extend it strongly forward with the sword, so that he has reason to bind your arm in the aforementioned manner; that while he thinks to seize you, you will tighten the arm coming towards you, forcefully pushing it down, which feeling crushed by the conceived pain will cause him to abandon the thrust, whereupon at your will you will be able to strike his face with a thrust.

[66] (P160.S0)
The seventh way to attack will be that you will make him see you giving a reverse strike, and immediately you will strike him with a forehand to the leg, bringing yourself back to guard with the sword in front.

[67] (P161.S0)
The contrary is that while he makes a strike from the reverse, you shall not move, but as he wishes to strike you with the aforementioned forehand, you will throw your right foot back, delivering a transverse forehand strike to the arm of his sword.

[68] (P162.S0)
The eighth way is that you will make a feint to strike him on the head and then you will thrust with your weak foot towards his right side, and you will place your dagger under his sword, striking him with a downward cut to the leg, so that the right foot follows the left from behind.

[69] (P163.S0)
His opposite is that while he makes a feint to strike you with a reverse, you will have your eye on his hands without moving, but while he steps forward with his left foot to strike you with a forehand, you will quickly withdraw your right foot back and deliver a half forehand to his sword hand.

[70] (P164.S0)
The ninth manner of attacking is that you will step with your left foot towards his right side, striking him on the right temple with a reverse blow, and immediately you will strike him in the face with the edge of the brocchero.

[71] (P165.S0)
The contrary of this is that when he shall attempt to offend you with the reverse, you, withdrawing your right foot back, will set yourself in a guard facing him.

[72] (P166.S0)
The tenth manner is that you will step with your left foot towards his right side, striking him with a reverse blow to his right temple.

[73] (P166.S1)
Then you will step back somewhat with your left foot, feigning to strike him with a downward blow to the head, and subsequently returning the aforementioned left foot towards his right side, you will strike his head with an upward cut, allowing your right foot to move behind the left.

[74] (P167.S0)
His opposite will be that when the enemy comes to strike you with a reverse, you will strike him with the true edge of your sword, and while he feigns a forehand, you will go with the sword in a guard of the face; but when he wishes to strike you with another reverse, you will immediately, by stepping with your foot to the opposite side, wound his left temple with a half forehand.

[75] (P168.S0)
The eleventh strike is that you will strike him with a reverse to his right temple, giving him a blow to the belly with your foot.

[76] (P168.S1)
Then, stepping back with the rear foot, you will strike the head with a downward blow.

[77] (P169.S0)
The opposite of this is that in the thrust he will make with the reverse, you will strike him with the true edge, and when he attempts to hit you with the pommel, you will immediately deliver a thrust to the shin of his leg, and thus you will go into a guard position, avoiding his direct attack.

[78] (P170.S0)
The .xii.

[79] (P170.S1)
The offense is that you will step forward with your left foot towards his right side, feigning to strike him with a reverse, but throughout this, you will pull back the hilt of the sword, placing your dagger under his sword hand and giving him a thrust to the face.

[80] (P171.S0)
The opposite of this is that in the appearance he will make of his reverse, you will place against it the true edge, but while he draws his sword back to thrust at you, you will once again place yourself with the true edge, pressing the enemy's sword towards your weaker parts, and thus you will have defended yourself from the thrust, pushing him away as soon as you can with a false strike to the face.

[81] (P172.S0)
The .xiii.

[82] (P172.S1)
The offense is that you will pass with the left towards his right side, striking him simultaneously with a reverse transverse blow to his right thigh, and by making yourself small, you will position yourself in the head guard, so that the right leg follows the left from behind.

[83] (P173.S0)
The contrary is that when he comes to strike you with a reverse, you, withdrawing your right foot back, will deliver such a blow to his sword arm.

[84] (P174.S0)
The .xiiii.

[85] (P174.S1)
The offense is that you will perceive the left foot with its right side, making an attempt to strike it with a reverse blow to the head; nonetheless, you will pass with the right over his hands, wounding him in the head with a descending strike in such a way that the right leg follows behind the left.

[86] (P175.S0)
The opposite of this is that in the passing that he will make with the reverse strike, you will close the sword together with the broc chero, and as he will rush to give you a downward strike, you will turn a reverse strike towards his right temple.

[87] (P176.S0)
The .xv.

[88] (P176.S1)
The offense is, that by withdrawing the sword back and thrusting a point into his right temple in conjunction with the brocchero, so that the strong foot of the weak follower has avoided every harmful blow.

[89] (P177.S0)
The contrary is that while he makes the aforementioned thrust, you will strike it with the false edge of the sword, wounding him on the face with a forehand cut.

[90] (P178.S0)
The .xvi.

[91] (P178.S1)
The offense is that you will step forward with your left foot in a great stride towards his right side, and in such a movement, you will take the enemy's sword with the hand of the brocchero, striking him on the right temple with a reverse blow.

[92] (P179.S0)
The opposite of the aforementioned is that in the arc that you will make for the sake of the grip, you will strike him in the face with a half mandritto.

[93] (P180.S0)
The .xvii.

[94] (P180.S1)
The offense is, that you, advancing with your weaker foot towards his right side, will strike him a blow to his right temple.

[95] (P180.S2)
Then you will take your sword with the hand of the brocchero in the middle, giving it the way of the hand into the face, or you will want a good pull of hair.

[96] (P181.S0)
The contrary is that while he comes to strike you with a reverse, you will suddenly make a half turn of the fist, avoiding it, and as he takes his sword in the middle to give you a slap to the face, you will strike the incoming arm with the edge of the buckler, also delivering a forehand blow to his face.
