[1] (P0.S0)
[ 1r ] F ※ I + O ※ R Furlan of Cividale d'Austria, who was of Master Benedetto of the noble house of the Liberi from Premariacco of the diocese of the Patriarchate of Aquileia, in his youth wished to undertake the art of arms and the art of fighting in the Sword ¶ Of spear, axe, sword, and dagger, and of grappling on foot and on horseback, in armor and without armor.

[2] (P1.S0)
¶ And in the court of great Lords, princes, dukes, marquises, and counts, knights and squires, this Art is so esteemed.

[3] (P1.S1)
¶ That the said Fiore has been 
more than once requested by many 
Lords and knights and squires 
to learn from the said Fiore this 
art of fencing and of fighting in the 
barrier, which art he has shown 
to many Italian and German masters 
and other great Lords who have 
had the duty to fight in the barrier.

[4] (P1.S2)
¶ And 
Wide to infinity that they have no need 
to fight.

[5] (P1.S3)
¶ And of some who have been my Scholars who have the skill to fight in the Bar ¶ of whom I will make mention and memory here.

[6] (P2.S0)
¶ First  
of them was the noble and gallant knight  
Master Piero del Verde, who  
was to fight with Master Piero of the Crown, both of whom  
were Germans.

[7] (P2.S1)
¶ And the Batagla should be at Perosa.

[8] (P3.S0)
¶ Yet to the valiant knight Master Nicolo Wriçilino the Teutonic, who was to fight with Master Nicolo the Englishman.

[9] (P3.S1)
The field was given to Imola.

[10] (P4.S0)
¶ Yet to the notable valiant, and gallant knight Master Galeazzo of the Captains of Grimello, called from Mantua, who was to engage in combat with the valiant knight Master Buçichardo of France, the field was in Padua.

[11] (P5.S0)
¶ Yet to the valiant squire Lancelot of Becharia from Pavia, who with six points of sharpened lance on horseback, faced the valiant knight Master Baldassare of the Teutonic Order, whom he was to combat in Imola at the barrier.

[12] (P6.S0)
¶ To the valiant squire Çoanino of Baiio from Milan, who, in Pavia at the castle, faced the brave squire Sram, a German, in three points of lance on horseback.

[13] (P6.S1)
¶ And then he made three strikes with the Axe, and three strikes with the Sword, and three strikes with the Dagger in the presence of the Most Noble Prince and Lord, Master the Duke of Milan and of Lady the Duchess, and of countless other Lords and Ladies.

[14] (P7.S0)
¶ Still to the cautious knight Master Açço of Castell Barcho who once had to fight with Çuanne di Ordelaffi.

[15] (P7.S1)
¶ And another time with the valiant and good knight Master Jacomo of Boson, and the field should be at the pleasure of the Lord Duke of Milan,

[16] (P8.S0)
Of these and others whom I, Fiore the master, have taught, I am very pleased because I have been well rewarded and have received the honor and love of my students and their relatives.

[17] (P8.S1)
I say also that this art I have always shown secretly, so that no one is present at the demonstration except the Scholar, and some discreet relative, and if anyone else is there, it is by grace or courtesy, with the sacred promise that they will not reveal any of the secrets of me, Fiore the Master.

[18] (P9.S0)
¶ And with great mind!

[19] (P9.S1)
"but the guard of the Masters of fencing!"

[20] (P9.S2)
And from his school, they, out of envy, have invited me to play with the sword, both cutting and thrusting, in a suit of armor without any other weapon except for a pair of gloves made of chamois, and all this has happened because I did not wish to practice with them, nor do I wish to teach anything of my art.

[21] (P10.S0)
¶ And this incident has happened five times that I have been asked.

[22] (P10.S1)
¶ And five times for my honor I have been compelled to fight in strange places without relatives and without friends, having no hope in others, except in God, in the art, and in myself, Fiore, and in my sword.

[23] (P10.S2)
¶ And by the grace of God, I, Fiore, have remained with honor and without injury to my person.

[24] (P11.S0)
¶ Yet I, Fiore, say to my Scholars that they should engage in the fight in the Bar, for in the fight in the Bar, it is very important!

[25] (P11.S1)
of lesser danger than to fight with cutting and thrusting swords in a half-swording manner, for he who plays with cutting swords, a single cover that he makes, in that blow gives him death.

[26] (P12.S0)
¶ And one who fights in the Sbarra and is well-armed can receive many wounds.

[27] (P12.S1)
Yet it can win the battle.

[28] (P12.S2)
¶ Yet there is another thing that rarely perishes for anyone, for it is taken by surprise.

[29] (P12.S3)
¶ Therefore, I say that I would rather strike three times in the Guard than once with the Cutting Sword, as mentioned above.

[30] (P13.S0)
¶ And I say that the man who fights in the Sword, being well-armed and knowing the art of fighting, and having the advantages that can be taken, if he is not valiant, he will surely be well beaten, so that he can say, for the grace of God, that never has any of my students been defeated in this art.

[31] (P13.S1)
In her, I have always remained with honor.

[32] (P14.S0)
¶ Yet I say, for the aforementioned Fiore, that these Lords, knights and squires, to whom I have shown this art of combat, have been content with my teaching, wanting nothing else but to have me as their master.

[33] (P15.S0)
¶ Yet I say that none of my scholars, in particular those mentioned above, have ever had a book on the art of combat other than Master Galeazzo of Mantua. ¶ Although he said that without books, there will never be a good Master or student in this art.

[34] (P15.S1)
¶ And I, Fiore, confirm it to be true that this art is so vast that there is no man of such great memory that he could retain in his mind without books even a fourth part of this art.

[35] (P15.S2)
¶ Therefore, if he does not know at least a quarter part of this art, he would not be a master.

[36] (P16.S0)
¶ That I, Fiore, know how to read, and write, and draw, and having books in this art, have studied well for 40 years.

[37] (P16.S1)
For many years now, I am still not a perfect Master in this art, although I have been held by great lords who have been my scholars, and I am indeed a perfect Master in the aforementioned art.

[38] (P16.S2)
¶ And I say that if I had studied as much in law, in decretals, and in medicine as I have studied in the art of arms, I would be a doctor in those three sciences.

[39] (P16.S3)
¶ And in this science of arms, one must have great effort and struggle, with the expense of being a good scholar, we say otherwise.

[40] (P17.S0)
Considering I, the aforementioned Fiore, that in this art few masters are found, and wishing that a memory be made of me in it, I shall create a book encompassing the entire art and all the things which I know, of weapons and techniques and other matters according to the order given to me by that high Lord who above all for martial virtues pleases me more, and merits more from this my book for his nobility than any other Lord whom I have ever seen, and may I see only my illustrious and exalted Lord, the mighty Prince Messer NICOLÒ Marquis of Este, Lord of the Noble City of Ferrara, Modena, Reggio, Parma, etc., to whom I wish a good life and prosperous fortune with victory over his enemies. Amen.

[41] (P18.S0)
Here begins the Second Book according to the arrangement of my Lord the Marquis, and let us ensure that nothing is lacking in the art, for I am certain that my Lord will grant me good merit for his great nobility and courtesy.

[42] (P19.S0)
¶ And we begin with the embrace, which is of two kinds: one for solace, and the other for anger, which is for life with every deceit and falsehood and cruelty that can be done.

[43] (P19.S1)
And of that which is done for life, I wish to speak and show for reason, and mainly to gain the prizes that are customary when one fights for life.

[44] (P20.S0)
¶ The man who wishes to embrace must be aware of whom he embraces, whether he is stronger than he or if he is greater in stature, or if he is too young or truly too old.

[45] (P20.S1)
Also to see if one places oneself in the guards of embracing, and of all these things it is necessary to foresee.

[46] (P21.S0)
¶ And nothing less, one must always put oneself in the strongest or weakest of the grips and always defend against the grips of his opponent.

[47] (P22.S0)
¶ And if your enemy is unarmed, wait to strike him in the most painful and perilous places, such as in the eyes, in the nose, in the temples, under the chin, and in the flanks.

[48] (P22.S1)
And no less, watch if you can come to the grips of the binds, whether armed or unarmed, as one and the other may be.

[49] (P23.S0)
¶ Furthermore, I say that to embrace one wishes to have strong choices, to know how to seize the advance, to know how to make breaks, to break arms and legs, to know bindings, to bind arms in such a way that the man has no more defense nor can depart in his freedom, to know how to strike in the most perilous place.

[50] (P23.S1)
¶ Yet it is known that one can place oneself on the ground without the danger of oneself.

[51] (P23.S2)
¶ Yet it is necessary to learn to unbind arms and legs in various ways.

[52] (P23.S3)
¶ All these things I will write and therefore depict in this book, as much as the art requires.

[53] (P24.S0)
¶ We have said what it means to embrace, now we shall speak of the guards of embracing.

[54] (P24.S1)
¶ The guards of the embrace can be made in various ways.

[55] (P24.S2)
"and one way is better than the other."

[56] (P24.S3)
¶ But these guards are the best in armor and without armor, although God knows that the guards are not established for the taken grips that are made.

[57] (P25.S0)
¶ And these are the first four Masters whom you see with the crowns upon their heads; for them, the guards of the Embrace are shown, namely the Long Position and the Boar's Tooth, which stand one against the other, and then they form the Iron Gate and the Front Position, one against the other.

[58] (P25.S1)
¶ And these guards can perform all the things that have been previously mentioned regarding embracing in arms and without arms, that is, holds and bindings and breaks, etc. ¶ Now it is necessary to make it so that the guards are recognized by the Masters of the Play, and the scholars of the players, and the players of the Masters, and the remedy against them, although always the remedy is placed directly against the counter, and sometimes directly [86] the remedy or directly all their plays.

[59] (P25.S2)
And of this we shall make clarity.

[60] (P26.S0)
¶ We say that to know the guards, or positions, and the light things, first that the guards have their weapons in hand, one against the other, and do not touch one with the other.

[61] (P26.S1)
And they stand alert and firm, one against the other, to see what the companion intends to do.

[62] (P26.S2)
¶ And these are called positions or guards or the first Masters of the Battle.

[63] (P26.S3)
¶ And these wear a crown upon their heads, for they are placed in a position and in a manner to make great defense with such a bearing.

[64] (P26.S4)
¶ And they are the principles of that art, that is of that art of the weapon with which the said Masters stand in guard.

[65] (P27.S0)
¶ And so it is to say, place yourself in guard.

[66] (P27.S1)
¶ And the guard is so much to say that the man guards himself, and defends himself with it, from the wounds of his enemy.

[67] (P27.S2)
¶ And so it must be said that there is a way to engage the enemy to offend him without the danger of oneself.

[68] (P28.S0)
¶ The other 
Master, who follows the guards, comes 
to teach about the guards, and he comes to defend 
against another player with the strikes that are from the 
guards that are in front.

[69] (P28.S1)
And this Master also bears the crown, and is called the second Master.

[70] (P28.S2)
¶ Yet it is called the great remedy because it provides the remedy that no harm is done to him from wounds or that no dishonor is done to him in that art which are the aforementioned positions or guards.

[71] (P29.S0)
¶ And this second remedy is for some players under whom they play those games that could be played, and the Master who, before the remedy, takes that cover or grip that makes the said remedy.

[72] (P29.S1)
And these players will wear a badge under the knee.

[73] (P29.S2)
And these players will play all the games of the remedy until another Master is found who will counter the remedy and all his players.

[74] (P30.S0)
¶ And because he does this against the remedy and against his players, he will bear the livery of the Master of remedy and of his players, that is, the crown on his head and the livery beneath the knee. And this King is called Master of the third, and is called against because he will be against the other Masters and against his own plays.

[75] (P31.S0)
¶ I also say that in some places in the art, one finds the fourth magister, which acts against the third master, that is, the opposite of the remedy.

[76] (P31.S1)
And this King, and the Master Fourth called Master Fourth.

[77] (P31.S2)
¶ And of [92] called against against r io, ¶ Although few games pass the master in the art.

[78] (P31.S3)
¶ And if they are made more, it is done with peril.

[79] (P31.S4)
And this is enough of what has been said.

[80] (P32.S0)
¶ As we have spoken here before about the guards of embracing, and of the Second Master regarding the remedy and his players, and of the Third Master against the Second Master and his players, and of the Fourth Master who is called against the counter, just as these Masters and players have to receive the art of embracing in armor and without armor, so they have to receive the art of the lance with the lances and their guards, Masters and players.

[81] (P32.S1)
¶ And similarly with the Axe, and with the sword of one hand and of two hands.

[82] (P32.S2)
And similarly with the dagger.

[83] (P33.S0)
¶ Thus, for the effect, these masters and players, called by their insignia and devices, have to preserve all the art of fencing on foot and on horseback, both in armor and without armor.

[84] (P33.S1)
According to how they do in the play of embracing.

[85] (P34.S0)
¶ And this is understood only because it is necessary to be guards and masters in the other arts and remedies and oppositions, as in the art of embracing, so that the book may be freely understood.

[86] (P35.S0)
¶ Although the Rubrics and the figures, and the games will show all the art so well that it can be fully understood.

[87] (P36.S0)
¶ Now let us pay attention to the figures depicted and to their plays and to their words, which will show us the truth.
