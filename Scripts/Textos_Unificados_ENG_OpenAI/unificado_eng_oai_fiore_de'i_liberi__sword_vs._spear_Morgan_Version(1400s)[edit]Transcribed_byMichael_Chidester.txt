[1] (P313.S0)
[ 18r-b ] I wait here in the teeth of the boar, all cuts and thrusts I know how to deliver, lances, swords, and darts, whoever knows how to do it, for I shall be able to defend myself against all.

[2] (P313.S1)
And thus what I will do, the long tail guard can be done by others as well.

[3] (P313.S2)
I step off the path to the cross, parrying, so that I am thrust at, and when I have parried the point of the advance of the weapon, I hesitate.

[4] (P313.S3)
That I may not be struck by the person, for another time it is necessary for me to counter immediately.
