[1] (P214.S0)
[ 19r-a ] ¶ Here begins Sword and Dagger to play.

[2] (P214.S1)
The advantage is great to those who know how to wield it.

[3] (P214.S2)
The Master is respected in this guard.

[4] (P214.S3)
And the guard is called the boar's tooth.

[5] (P214.S4)
"Come strikes and thrusts that I know how to guard against."

[6] (P214.S5)
The right foot with the rebound shall return.

[7] (P214.S6)
The close play is solely in the mind, and I cannot fail it.

[8] (P214.S7)
One by one, let him come who wishes to fight against me.

[9] (P214.S8)
If it does not come to me, I will ruin it in a turn.

[10] (P215.S0)
[ 19r-b ] ¶ The my master against!

[11] (P215.S1)
the point makes such a cover  
and suddenly strikes to the face or to the chest.

[12] (P215.S2)
And with the dagger against the sword, one always wishes for close play.

[13] (P215.S3)
Here I am close, and I can well strike you, whether you wish it or not, you must endure it.

[14] (P216.S0)
[ 19r-c ] ¶ If the player who has denounced me had known how to make such a defense, if he had his weary hand placed at this manner behind his elbow, turning it in such a way as shown here, I would not have needed to act against the master who stands with the dagger in position.

[15] (P217.S0)
[19r-d] ¶ If the master who is in position with the dagger and sword sees a downward strike aimed at the head, he steps forward and makes this cover quickly, turning the elbow.

[16] (P217.S1)
And that one can strike well immediately.

[17] (P217.S2)
Also the sword, with which he can bind it with his arm, in such a way that the fourth play of the sword of one hand can be performed.

[18] (P217.S3)
And also in the dagger at the third play, you will find that middle bind.

[19] (P217.S4)
that near the turn is closed at a span.

[20] (P219.S0)
[ 19v-a ] ¶ This is a play of dagger against sword. 
He who has the dagger holds the sword by the hilt, saying, "I will strike you with my dagger before you draw the sword from its scabbard."

[21] (P219.S1)
And that of the sword says among the pure that I am prepared.

[22] (P219.S2)
And as one wishes to draw the dagger, so does the one with the sword act according to what is depicted here behind.

[23] (P220.S0)
[ 19v-b ] ¶ When he raises his arm to strike me with the dagger, I immediately place the guard against his arm with the dagger so that he cannot make a thrust at me.

[24] (P220.S1)
And I immediately draw my sword, and if I can wound him before he can touch me with his dagger.

[25] (P220.S2)
I could also take away the dagger from the hand in the manner that the first master of the dagger does.

[26] (P220.S3)
¶ Yet it is good to bind him in a medium bind that is the third play of the dagger of the first master, which is a remedy.

[27] (P221.S0)
[ 19v-c ] ¶ This is another technique of sword and dagger.  
He who holds the sword with the point on the ground as you see, says that of the dagger that he holds by the hilt,  
While you have the dagger in your hand, in the moment that you wish to strike with the dagger, I will strike my sword  
over your arm, and in that moment I will withdraw my sword,  
returning with the point straight towards you. And in this way I can  
wound you with my sword before you can wound me with your  
dagger.

[28] (P222.S0)
[ 19v-d ] ¶ This is a similar part to the one presented here before, although it is not done in the same manner as that which is stated here before.

[29] (P222.S1)
This play is done in such a way as I have said before, that when you raise your dagger to strike me, I will immediately raise my sword upright under your dagger, placing the point of my sword's guard into your face, turning the foot that is in front inward.

[30] (P222.S2)
And thus I can wound you according to what is depicted before me.

[31] (P223.S0)
[ 20r-a ] ¶ This game is of the Master who makes the part here before.

[32] (P223.S1)
That according to what he has said, in such a manner I do.

[33] (P223.S2)
That you see well that your dagger you cannot make me any harm.
