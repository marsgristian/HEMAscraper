[1] (P14.S0)
[ 4v.2 ] Measure of the sword of two hands.

[2] (P14.S1)
Chapter II.

[3] (P14.S2)
The sword wishes to have a proper measure,  
It wants to reach the pommel beneath the arm,  
As it appears here in my writing.  
To avoid being caught in a snare:  
Round is the pommel to fit in the closed fist,  
And this is done so as not to enter the trap.

[4] (P14.S3)
And make this still be of use to you, That the grip be always of a span. He who lacks this measure is confused, So that your mind does not deceive you. The long elbow is as long as the grip, The pommel together, which does not condemn you.

[5] (P14.S4)
In the strong and square rise, with the wide sword and thrust at the point, that for striking and cutting fulfills the duty.

[6] (P14.S5)
Make sure you observe and understand this addition: If with sword in hand you wish to test, Make sure it cuts four fingers at the point, With the maintenance that is stated above. Note well the written instruction.
