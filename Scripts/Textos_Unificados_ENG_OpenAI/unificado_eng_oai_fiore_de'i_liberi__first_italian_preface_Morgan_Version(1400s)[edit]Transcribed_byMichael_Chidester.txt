[1] (P0.S0)
[ 1r ] Fiore Furlan of Cividale of Austria, who was of my master Benedetto from the noble house of the Liberi, from the region of the diocese of the patriarchate of Aquileia, in his youth set out to take up arms and the art of combat in the open field to the utmost, ¶ with lance, axe, sword, and dagger, and to grapple on foot, and on horseback, both in armor and without armor.

[2] (P1.S0)
¶ And in the courts of great lords, princes, dukes, marquises, and counts, knights and squires, to undertake this art, ¶ That the aforementioned flower has been sought more and more by many lords and knights and squires to take up this art from the aforementioned flower, of arming and of fighting in the open ¶ beyond the threshold, which art he has shown to many Italian and German masters and other great lords who have had to fight in the open.

[3] (P1.S1)
¶ And also, to the Infinite that we must not strike.

[4] (P1.S2)
¶ And of some who have been my students who have not yet had to fight in the open, ¶ I wish to make here a record of some of them by name.

[5] (P2.S0)
¶ And the first notable and gallant knight was my master Piero of the green who was to fight with miserable Piero of the crown, who were both Germans.

[6] (P2.S1)
¶ And the battle should be at close quarters.

[7] (P3.S0)
¶ Yet to the valiant knight, poor Nicholo, a noble German, who was to fight with the English Nicholo, the field was granted at Imola.

[8] (P4.S0)
¶ There was also a notable and valiant, and gallant knight, my lord Galeaz of the captains of Grimello, called from Mantua, who was to fight with the valiant knight, my lord Buçichardo of France, and the field was at Padua.

[9] (P5.S0)
[ 1v ] To the valiant squire Lanzilotto de Beccharia of Pavia, ¶ Who made a thrust with a lance of tempered iron on horseback, against the brave knight Master Baldesar Todescho, ¶ And they were also to fight in the open field, and this took place in Imola.

[10] (P6.S0)
¶ Also to the valiant squire Zohannj of Baio from Milan, who fought in Pavia in the castle against the brave squire Sram, German, with three thrusts of a lance with sharpened iron, on horseback ¶ And then he fought on foot with three strikes of the halberd, and three strikes of the sword, and three strikes of the dagger, im[!]

[11] (P6.S1)
presence of the most noble lord Duke of Milan, and of madam the Duchess and of countless other lords and ladies.

[12] (P7.S0)
¶ To the cautious knight, miserable Azo of Castelbarcho, who was to once combat with my lord Zohanni of the Ordelaffi.

[13] (P7.S1)
¶ And another time with that valiant and good knight, my lord Jacomo da Besen, and the field should be to the pleasure of the lord Duke of Milan,

[14] (P8.S0)
Of these and others whom I, Fiore, have taught, I am very pleased because I have been well rewarded, and thus I have gained the honor and the love of my students and their parents.

[15] (P8.S1)
I also say that to whom I have taught this art, I have taught it secretly to you, as it has not been given to any other person except the student and some of his close relatives.

[16] (P8.S2)
Although those who have stood at my side have not been able to speak of any play that they have seen from me, Fiore.

[17] (P9.S0)
¶ And I have kept myself safe from the masters of fencing and their students.

[18] (P9.S1)
And they, out of envy, the masters have invited me to play with swords of cutting and thrusting in a half-suit of armor without any other weapon save for a pair of leather gloves, and all this has happened because I did not wish to practice with them, nor did I wish to teach anything of my art.

[19] (P10.S0)
¶ And this incident has occurred five times that I have been asked.

[20] (P10.S1)
¶ And five times for my honor it has been necessary for me to play in strange places without relatives and without friends, having no hope in anything else, except in God, in the art, and in my flower, and in my sword.

[21] (P10.S2)
And for the grace of God, I, Fiore, have remained with honor, and without injury to my person.

[22] (P11.S0)
¶ Now I, Fiore, say to my students that they must fight in the open, for to fight in the open, is a matter of great importance!

[23] (P11.S1)
of less danger, than to fight with cutting swords, and with the point to thrust in the armor.

[24] (P11.S2)
For he who plays with swords, a single cover that fails that blow brings him death.

[25] (P12.S0)
¶ And one who fights in armor, and well-armed, can still receive many wounds and yet win the battle.

[26] (P12.S1)
¶ Yet there is another thing that rarely causes anyone to perish, for they are taken by surprise.

[27] (P12.S2)
¶ So I say I would like to fight three times in the guard!

[28] (P12.S3)
], that only once with cutting swords as stated above.

[29] (P13.S0)
And I say that the man who is to fight in the field, being well-armed and knowing the art of combat, and having the advantages that can be taken, if he is not valiant, he would do well to hang himself; for I can say, by the grace of God, that never has any of my scholars in this art been a coward, for they have always remained with honor in this art.

[30] (P14.S0)
¶ Yet I say to you, esteemed lords, knights, and squires, that those whom I have shown this art of combat have been content with my teaching, not wishing for any other master than the aforementioned Fiore.

[31] (P15.S0)
¶ Yet I say that none of these scholars named here ever had a book in the art of combat other than my master Galeazzo of Mantua.

[32] (P15.S1)
¶ Well, I say that without a book there will never be a good master or student in this art.

[33] (P15.S2)
¶ And I, Fiore, confirm that truly this art is so extensive that there is no man in the world of such great memory who could retain in his mind without books even a quarter part of this art.

[34] (P15.S3)
¶ A master who does not know the fourth part of this art would no longer be a master.

[35] (P16.S0)
¶ That I, Fiore, knowing the law, and writing and designing, and having books in this art, have studied well for more than twenty years in it.

[36] (P16.S1)
The anchovy!

[37] (P16.S2)
I am not well for a perfect master in this art.

[38] (P16.S3)
Although I have been taught by great lords who have been my students, I am a good and perfect master in this art.

[39] (P16.S4)
¶ And I say that if I had studied in law, in decretals, and in medicine as I have studied in the art of arms, I would be a doctor in those three sciences.

[40] (P16.S5)
¶ And in this science of arms, I have had great effort, and struggle, and expense to be but a good scholar, let us say otherwise.

[41] (P17.S0)
Considering that in this art few masters are found in the world, and wishing that I may be remembered in this art, I shall make a book encompassing the entire art, and all the things that I know, and of weapons and of techniques and of other matters according to what we shall know how to do for the best, and for greater clarity.

[42] (P37.S0)
Here begins the second book, so that everyone may understand it easily.

[43] (P37.S1)
And we will do so by the comparison of five things, namely of masters who stand in guard.

[44] (P37.S2)
And of masters who are remedies, and of students, and of players, and of opponents of masters, and of students.

[45] (P37.S3)
The masters who stand in the place of guards that so much, and to the right!

[46] (P37.S4)
guard position.

[47] (P37.S5)
It is said that to post one, and to guard is to say to guard oneself from a single enemy, and so it is said that posting and guarding is strength.

[48] (P37.S6)
Here, it is advisable to break the posts without danger, coming to the purpose.

[49] (P38.S0)
The masters who stand in guard, stand one against the other, and do not touch one weapon with the other.

[50] (P38.S1)
And those masters will wear no crown on their heads, the other crowned masters who will be behind them will also wear a crown.

[51] (P38.S2)
And they are called masters of remedies.

[52] (P38.S3)
Those who play with these masters and with their students are called players.

[53] (P38.S4)
And the students of these masters of remedies wear a badge under the knee.

[54] (P38.S5)
And it begins with the covers, and the grips according to the master's remedy alone.

[55] (P38.S6)
And he will make so many plays that his master’s remedy could achieve, until he finds himself with the mastery of the remedy and of his students.

[56] (P38.S7)
And this with the contrary will bear a crown upon his head, and a livery beneath the knee, for he is the contrary of the master and of the scholars, for thus he bears such livery that the master remedies with all his scholars.

[57] (P38.S8)
And in some places you will find, the opposite will immediately remedy it.

[58] (P38.S9)
And in some places you will find the opposite of all the plays of the master remedy.

[59] (P38.S10)
Knowing that what is contrary is done to the master remedy, that contrary breaks all his plays of that cover or the pressure that he made.

[60] (P38.S11)
According to what you will find painted and written so well that the most excellent in you can be understood.

[61] (P39.S0)
And we shall begin first with the lance on horseback, and with the sword, and with grappling.

[62] (P39.S1)
And then from the lance on foot, and then from the sword in armor, and then from the sword with two hands, wide play.

[63] (P39.S2)
¶ And then close play, and then the play of the axe, and then certain techniques, and then the sword in one hand, and then the play of grappling on foot, and then the play of the dagger.

[64] (P39.S3)
And for this reason, you can see the whole art of armoring in this book, for nothing can be said that the glosses above the painted figures will not express well.
