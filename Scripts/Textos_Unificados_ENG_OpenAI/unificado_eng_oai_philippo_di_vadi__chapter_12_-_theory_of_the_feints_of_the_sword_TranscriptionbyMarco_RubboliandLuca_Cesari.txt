[ 12v.2 ] Â¶ Reason of the sword's sights.

[2] (P24.S1)
Chapter XII.

[3] (P24.S2)
Now I tell you and note my good saying, That when you are entered at half sword, You can well defend from every side, Following the art with good posturing.

[4] (P24.S3)
And they are called the sights a darkening That darkens others in defending, Nor does it allow to comprehend What one side wishes to do.

[5] (P24.S4)
I cannot show you as well with my words as I would with a sword; Let your mind delve into the art through my speech, and you shall take courage with reason.

[6] (P24.S5)
Since I admonish you and I teach you, and I make you with ingenuity follow what I write in many verses, to discover in the art both the foundation and the stream.
