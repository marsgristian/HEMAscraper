[1] (P12.S0)
[ 23.1 ] I will explain how the play of sword and dagger is governed in the best and least dangerous manner possible, guiding you in the way that I will describe in this discourse.

[2] (P13.S0)
[23.2] Firstly, it is necessary to pay attention to carrying the sword well; therefore, I wish to observe only three forms in positioning oneself, although there are many guards, as many have written, of which I will speak somewhat, but I do not observe them, being able to perform everything with the knee in three guards. It is indeed true that at times a man will find himself in play, or in the handling of hands, doing many things in more forms: but if you judge minutely, you will find that it will always be the same, that is to say, what I will describe in the three guards, even if they may seem varied. But in conclusion, that is in striking, you will find that in the three forms I observe, there are all the strikes that can be made, and those that I present, I hold to be the briefest and least dangerous, with which a man can strike most of the time, and also will not be disconcerted from the sword; because they are not with artificial or forced movements, of which we only remember in times of jest, but are so natural that even in a fury of anger, they will not be taken from him.

[3] (P13.S1)
To which one must pay great attention, as it teaches, since a dispute never arises without anger.

[4] (P13.S2)
It is true that in all ways one must train the life, for agility in this art can do much, but of much greater importance is to know the timing, without which, as has already been seen and will be seen, one cannot accomplish anything of significance.

[5] (P14.S0)
[24.1] Indeed, in all ways one must train the life, for agility in this art is of great importance, but of much greater significance is the ability to recognize the timing, without which, as has already been seen and will be seen, one cannot accomplish anything of consequence.

[6] (P14.S1)
[25] At that same time, thrusting with the straight step forward: and if the enemy brings the sword from below towards your weary side, keep your eye on striking with the dagger from the hand outside the sword, wounding to the face, retreating in the same posture; and in your retreat, if the enemy thrusts at you, evade a little backward with your waist, and catch the enemy's sword between your dagger and your sword, that is, the dagger above and the sword below, and strike to the face. And if he were to strike back at your head, meet it with the weapons accompanied together, and be careful to parry with the strong of the sword while quickly accompanying the dagger. And as the enemy strikes a great blow to your head, parry with the sword, for he has greater advantage; and if you parry with the dagger, you will be in worse trouble, for many experiences have shown that the dagger poorly used is the death of a man, and it is very difficult to parry a great knife blow with the dagger because if you do not catch the sword with its strong, you can easily be disconcerted from hand, or have your grip taken. Therefore, one who does not have great timing with the help of evading the waist should not attempt to take the knife blow otherwise with the dagger, but with the strong of the sword.

[7] (P14.S2)
And if the enemy wishes to seize your sword with the dagger to strike at your leg, be aware that in order to achieve this effect, he will cover himself under the low dagger at the waist, where you, in that moment when he seeks to find your sword with the dagger, must be quick to free it with a slight retreat of the waist backward, and at the same time strike beneath his dagger. For if you are quick to free the sword, you will find a very wide opportunity to enter, and his blow will remain halfway, meaning that he cannot reach your leg, for he brings forward the head, in such a way that he cannot strike, as long as you do not allow your sword to be hindered, and I have explained the reason to you another time, speaking of the sword alone.

[8] (P14.S3)
It is indeed true that even in such a melee one can strike at the leg, but in this manner: You must approach the enemy in such a way that you cannot evade his blade from below, that is, you can only evade it from above, where with the dagger you cannot hinder it. And as you push him in this way, you will be able to strike at the leg with less danger. However, I wish for greater advantage that you observe another rule, which is that when you have closed in on the enemy, you should enter vigorously with a thrust, and you will not be in such danger of being wounded, and you will also strike in less time. But as I have said, I do not observe these things, as they are very dangerous; therefore, let us return to our original purpose of the straight line, that is, in the first guard, and let us suppose that one positions himself in a well-covered guard in whatever form he wishes. Close in on him and pay attention to how his sword is positioned, whether high or low, and then at the right moment, as I say, close in, and see to strike him towards the most exposed part, and be quick in striking and quick in retreating. And if by chance, as you enter, he follows you, retreating quickly will defend you, paying attention to when you encounter his weak point with your strong point, and by doing this, you have time to parry and also to strike at the same time, according to how you find yourself. That is, if while the enemy attacks you, you find yourself advancing with your step, having drawn your blow, the time will be that you gather and parry simultaneously. And if you are gathered, I want you to parry and enter at that very moment. And if the enemy positions himself with the sword low, I want you to close in on him, with one foot advancing the other, and as you find yourself at a distance to reach, enter covering his weak point with your strong point without touching his sword. And if in that moment he strikes your sword from high to low, evade from the bind, and strike above with the dagger to the face. And if he strikes your sword with the dagger from outside, retreat inside with the sword and strike from below. And be aware that one must have a quick eye to see where the enemy carries his dagger, and many will give you ample time to enter, for they become disordered with the dagger and make a thousand feints, which are deceptive, where you can always enter in a straight line.

[9] (P14.S4)
And in this first form, you should not use the dagger to strike the enemy's sword, except in the occasion that you have delivered a blow, and your sword is out of reach, so that the enemy strikes you so quickly that you cannot recover your sword; then I want you to strike with the dagger, gathering your step to recover it. But avoid reducing yourself to such terms, as they are dangerous; it is enough that I teach you this remedy, so that in such a case you are not entirely lost, but can somehow find a way to engage in the fight: standing in this form, you can make feints in this manner: if you make a feint to the face, the enemy must bring his dagger to parry; and if he does not go for the feint, enter at that moment, and if he does, counter from the other side: and if in making the feint, the enemy wishes to parry and enter, use your dagger, striking his sword, and entering with the counter, do not let your own be hindered, and recognize the advantages.

[10] (P14.S5)
And this is what I wish to say about this first form.

[11] (P15.S0)
[ 28.2 ] There is the second form, which is that you will place yourself [ 29 ] with the sword held high, with the arm extended, keeping the tip of the sword elevated, so that the enemy cannot discern where you will strike down with your sword, where here it will be necessary to strike with the dagger, which you will hold with the arm extended, and the grip will be very useful on this occasion.

[12] (P15.S1)
While you remain in this form, strive to always stay in a narrow stance as much as possible, that is, in that position which you will find most comfortable and strong, keeping your shoulder straight forward as much as you can, leaning somewhat on the weak side of the dagger, that is, on your left leg, keeping the dagger extended, covering your face, for by leaning on the weak side, you will deliver the thrust with less effort, and return up more quickly: and I advise you in this second form of delivering the long thrust, to extend your arm well, bringing your waist in profile, and while you are in this form, pay attention to how the enemy positions themselves, for according to how the enemy will position themselves, you will govern yourself with the rule I shall state: Firstly, if the enemy delivers a thrust, I want you to strike with the dagger, and at that same moment enter where you will find the most exposed part, noting whether the thrust comes perpendicularly downward, or if it comes in a straight line. If the thrust descends perpendicularly, I want you to strike the thrust with the dagger outward towards the right side, for it is easier and shorter, and at that moment let your sword drop likewise while delivering the thrust, and returning up quickly with the step; and if the enemy thrusts at you in a straight line, you can parry it in three ways.

[13] (P15.S2)
The first from high to low, when he strikes you across the chest, and at that very moment, turning your body as much as you can, taking a step, and keeping the dagger always above the sword to prevent the enemy from raising his sword, for by doing this, you will easily return it to the dagger, or he will be forced to draw the sword to one side or the other.

[14] (P15.S3)
You can parry it in the second way, when the sword descends towards the weak part, by striking it outward on the weak side, and if he thrusts towards the strong side, strike the sword outward towards the right flank, and here strike with the knuckle of the hand, always entering at that moment, striking, and pulling the blow.

[15] (P15.S4)
One can also strike in this third manner, when the enemy thrusts, by moving the weak side somewhat out of the enemy's presence, gathering a little the straight step, so that with a little help from the dagger you will parry the thrust, and you will be able to wound.

[16] (P15.S5)
Now I want us to speak about how to bind the enemy in this same guard: Pay close attention to how the enemy positions himself, for it is of great utility to know this moment, which will be this: if the enemy holds a long sword, bind him in this manner: Step forward by half a pace so that you reach with your dagger above the enemy's sword by two palms, and keep an eye on whether he strikes at that moment; if he does, strike and enter: and if he does not strike, you can enter likewise by striking, or gain his sword with the dagger. And if the enemy stands with a short sword, bind him in this way: Step forward enough to know the distance to arrive without losing your footing, keeping your life in guard, and as you are at the moment of being able to arrive, thrust freely, returning quickly to guard; do not worry if you are well covered from the enemy's dagger, as long as his sword is back, the enemy easily standing in that form could thrust freely, where you can parry while returning to strike at that moment only: and take care not to let your life be abandoned so far forward that you do not have time to return quickly, therefore it is necessary to pay attention to all these things, so that you do not become disconcerted in such a way that you are not able to recover yourself swiftly.

[17] (P16.S0)
[31.2] There is another time in this guard, certainly difficult to execute, but resolute, that is, by closing in on the enemy so that his sword is but a palm away from your side, keeping the arm of the dagger extended as much as you can, leaning your body, making your sword, that is, the point, be in the presence of the enemy, and at that moment you will strike, entering with the thrust; and I say that it is difficult, but resolute and good, where a man could assure himself, having a jacket on, and he would have to deal with those who stand firm in guard, waiting for the other to strike first, and great judgment is required in knowing the distance, and also to have the eye if the enemy strikes at that moment, standing in this manner, that if the enemy strikes at you with a dagger, either straight or reversed, you can parry with the dagger, entering at that very moment; and if he strikes at your leg, you meet it head-on, for you have a great advantage, as I have said above.

[18] (P16.S1)
And here I shall conclude the second guard.

[19] (P17.S0)
[ 32.2 ] Now I shall discourse upon the third guard, or posture, and how one should govern oneself with sword and dagger, with all the advantage that is fitting for him.

[20] (P17.S1)
Thus, the third guard is in this form: you will place your weary foot forward in a proper stance, with your left arm extended, ensuring that the fist is aligned with your face, and that the point of the dagger is held high, keeping the arm straight and slightly arched, and that the hilt of the sword is somewhat distanced from your waist, and that the point of the sword is equal to the hilt of the dagger, distanced about a palm's length. By standing in this manner, you will be very well covered, and you will be able to govern yourself according to the time and movement that the enemy will make: if the enemy strikes directly at your head, I do not wish for you to respond otherwise than with the dagger, but rather to meet with the strong part of the dagger, and at that moment to thrust forward, taking a straight step ahead, as much as your nature allows, and then immediately withdrawing it back, while keeping the arm of the dagger steady, so that if the enemy doubles the strike on you, you can parry, as would be in this way: If the enemy strikes you with a straight thrust, and you parry it, and enter at that moment: if you abandon the arm of the dagger while making the step, and the enemy doubles the strike either from the reverse or straight, he could easily catch you; but if you remain firm with the dagger, you can parry the second blow and return to strike at that moment: if he strikes a backhanded blow to your head, I want you to parry with the dagger, making a slight bend of the waist, and bringing your right foot slightly back, and also striking at that moment, and immediately returning to guard.

[21] (P17.S2)
If he were to strike at your leg either straight or from the side, you can defend yourself in two ways: one, while he strikes, gather your weary step behind the straight, and as the enemy's sword has passed, you can enter with a thrust or a cut, according to what your will dictates.

[22] (P17.S3)
It is true that in this guard of withdrawing the leg, one must pay close attention to the distance of the enemy's sword, for if the blow were to strike your leg at its midpoint, you would not be able to withdraw it in such a way that it would not reach you; and I do not mean that it can be avoided except by a slight retreat.

[23] (P17.S4)
The second way is this: if the enemy strikes at your leg, you can parry with the dagger, and at that very moment, resolutely enter before the enemy can recover; however, be aware that it has only entered from one side, which is armed, for it is very difficult and dangerous; thus, if you are unarmed, I do not advise you to rely on it, but for those who are armed, it is very good: because there is the advantage of the step, which delivers the blow more forcefully and more long-reaching.

[24] (P17.S5)
You may also in this manner approach the enemy so closely that you surpass his sword with your dagger, where you will observe that as soon as you begin to gain it, you must not abandon it, but always follow it forward, for it will surely become yours; and by doing this, you will always have your sword available to strike wherever you wish freely; but if you allow him to recover it, he will have a great advantage against you.

[25] (P17.S6)
And whoever finds me satisfied with what I have promised, and with what I have deemed necessary for such a profession.

[26] (P17.S7)
Let no one oppose me, for I do not treat any matter particularly for those who are left-handed, or southpaw as it is commonly said; for in teaching how to strike and parry according to the guards, the art is as applicable to left-handed individuals as it is to right-handed ones, there being no other difference between them, save for their relation.

[27] (P17.S8)
Therefore, let each one understand me well, and practice diligently, for I assure myself of such profit in them that they will praise my labors; and perhaps one day I shall give them even more things.

[28] (P18.S0)
[ 35.2 ] THE END.
