[1] (P314.S0)
[ 32v-a ] ¶ We are masters who know well how to arm.

[2] (P314.S1)
And let no one who knows this art do it well.

[3] (P314.S2)
And of manual arms we care little 
for cuts and thrusts if the place allows it.

[4] (P315.S0)
· Short Position the Serpent · I am the short position the serpent better than the others I hold, To whom I will give a thrust, well he will parry the sign.

[5] (P316.S0)
· True Cross Position · [ 32v-b ] ¶ The True Cross Position that I wish to make against you, In me your points cannot enter.

[6] (P316.S1)
I will cover myself from you in the passing that I will make, and with the point I will strike you, without fail. For the other guards I can do little, as I know well how to arm myself that I cannot fail in the crossing, for in the passing and in the crossing, and in the striking, the art demands this to not fail.

[7] (P317.S0)
· · Serpentine sleep the soprano · [ 32v-c ] ¶ S ompn[!]

[8] (P317.S1)
Serpentine are the high ones, and well-armed with great pointed tips under hand, which are upright, and return to the flat.

[9] (P317.S2)
A strong thrust  
I will send you with it passing.

[10] (P317.S3)
She is my art that I know well how to do.

[11] (P317.S4)
Of your cuts I do not care at all, for I know in the art that with great thrusts I will give you a great part.

[12] (P318.S0)
· Iron Gate The Half · [32v-d] ¶ The iron gate is called the half, because in arms and without I make the points strong.

[13] (P318.S1)
And I will step off the path, with my weary foot, and I will thrust a point into your face, or with the point, and with the edge, I will enter between your arms in such a way that I will put you in a middle bind, in that which is called the pent and named before.

[14] (P319.S0)
Position Arrow is [33r-a] ¶ Carry[!]

[15] (P319.S1)
The arrow is called by name, great and pointed, going off the path.

[16] (P319.S2)
And if they come against me with a strike or a cut, I make a good cover and immediately I strike back against them.

[17] (P319.S3)
This is my art in which I do not waver.

[18] (P320.S0)
· Bastard Cross Position · [ 33r-b ] ¶ The position of the bastard cross is of true cross, so that one can willingly make it.

[19] (P320.S1)
Good covers, and thrusts,  
and cuts I make for use, always avoiding the blows off the path.

[20] (P320.S2)
And of my strikes, I make great and decisive blows.

[21] (P321.S0)
[ 33r-c ] ¶ And placed of true cross I am ensued with this cover passing off the road to the crossway.

[22] (P321.S1)
And of this cover, one will see what I can do; for my students, I can show it. They will perform my plays in their entirety, those that are of combat to the utmost. The art will be shown without doubt.

[23] (P322.S0)
[ 33r-d ] ¶ And I am the first student of the master who is before me.

[24] (P322.S1)
This point I make so that it may be of its own cover.

[25] (P322.S2)
Furthermore, I say that from the true cross guard and from the bastard cross guard, this thrust can be made, and I speak of suddenly striking with the sword against a thrust from the master or scholar who would be in the aforementioned guards or positions. The master or scholar must go low with the person and step outside the line, crossing the sword of the scholar, and with the point raised towards the face or the chest, and with the sword maintained low, as I depict here.

[26] (P323.S0)
[ 33v-a ] ¶ When I see that my point cannot enter into the chest or into the face through the visor, I raise the visor and then I place the point in the face.

[27] (P323.S1)
And if this is not enough for me, I will engage in the other stronger plays.

[28] (P324.S0)
[ 33v-b ] ¶ When I came to the grapples with this player, I knew the wound of the thrusts and for the weapons, nothing hindered me.

[29] (P324.S1)
But for the elbow, I think strongly that I will make it turn. If his arms are strong from behind, I will want to try it.

[30] (P325.S0)
When I saw that with the sword, nothing could be done to you.

[31] (P325.S1)
Immediately I took this embrace, which I grasp, and I perceive, and I feel that the weapons will not avail you at all, for I will place you in the strong bind below in this that is set before me. I will make you show it immediately.

[32] (P326.S0)
In the binding of below and strong key, I have secured you in such a way that you cannot escape, and strength will avail you nothing.

[33] (P326.S1)
I can challenge you, and I can give you death;  
I would write a letter that would not allow me to see it.

[34] (P326.S2)
You have neither sword nor armor on your head.

[35] (P326.S3)
You have little honor and will make a brief feast.

[36] (P327.S0)
[ 34r-a ] ¶ This play is of our first master of the true cross and of the bastard, namely, when one thrusts at him and the scholar awaits him in his guard, and immediately passes to the cover outside of the line and thrusts at him in the face, and with the tired foot he steps out of his foot that is before, in this manner that he depends on it to throw him to the ground so that the point of the sword advances beyond his neck.

[37] (P328.S0)
[ 34v-b ] ¶ Now I say that when a student has come to the grappling, seeing that he cannot harm his companion with his sword, he should engage in the embrace with his sword in this manner, that the student should throw his sword to the neck of the player, and his right foot should be placed straight against the tired foot of the player, and throw him to the ground on the right side.

[38] (P329.S0)
[ 34r-b ] ¶ When I come from the guard in the tight cover, if I cannot strike with the edge, I will strike with the point. And if I cannot strike with these two, I will strike with the hilt, or with the pommel.

[39] (P329.S1)
And this is done according to how the minds are.  
And when I am thus in the grips, and the player believes  
that I only wish to play with the sword.

[40] (P329.S2)
I set myself to embrace,  
if I see that I am advanced, And if not, I will strike him  
with the hilt to the face as I have previously said, according to what seems best to me.

[41] (P330.S0)
[ 34r-c ] ¶ As you can see, the student who is before me strikes the player in the face with the hilt of his sword, quickly preparing to strike him with the pommel in the face, as you can see illustrated below.

[42] (P331.S0)
[ 34r-d ] ¶ And now I say that this student who is before me, that if the player strikes him with the pommel of the sword in the face, he would have been able to do as I do, that is to step forward with the right foot directly into his stance.

[43] (P331.S1)
And to maintain 
his sword, place it at his neck to throw him to the ground 
as I do.

[44] (P332.S0)
[ 34v-c ] ¶ This scholar, unable to strike the player with harm, wishes to engage in grappling in this manner: the scholar places his sword within the right hand of the player.

[45] (P332.S1)
And what the scholar does is to enter with his sword and with his weary arm, under the right arm of the player to throw him to the ground, or to put him in a bind from below in the strong key.

[46] (P333.S0)
[ 34v-a ] ¶ Here this play is of the true cross guard in such a way, that.

[47] (P333.S1)
that here a scholar is in that position, and one comes to meet him, that immediately in his drawing of the player, the scholar must pass out of the way, and he can put the point in his face as you see done here.

[48] (P339.S0)
[ 34v-d ] ¶ This is a strong and good grip, which, having made the grip, the student places his foot behind the foot of the player.

[49] (P339.S1)
And the point of his sword he puts in his face.

[50] (P339.S2)
He can still throw him to the ground towards the right hand.

[51] (P340.S0)
[ 35r-a ] ¶ This is the counter to the master’s remedy and of all his students. For it is a true thing that whatever counter is made against the master’s remedy, that counter breaks the game of the master’s remedy and of all his students. And this I say of the spear, the sword, the dagger, and grappling, and of the whole art.

[52] (P340.S1)
Let us return to speak of the great master remedy.

[53] (P340.S2)
This master strike, on the contrary, places his left hand against the straight elbow of the player who makes the cover of the master strike remedy, and if he turns it with force to strike him directly as you will see here directly.

[54] (P341.S0)
I am a student of the master against whom I stand before, and I comply with his play.

[55] (P341.S1)
When the player is turned, I immediately strike him from behind under his right arm.

[56] (P341.S2)
And under the hood on the crown of the head, or in the buttocks with reverence, or under the knees, or in any other place that I find uncovered.

[57] (P342.S0)
[ 35r-c ] ¶ This sword serves as a sword and for the axe, and it does not cut from the handle to the end, but rather it is meant to cut near the point and in the front it wishes to cut, and it must have a fine point, and the cut should be of length a little less.

[58] (P342.S1)
And the small wheel that under the elbow can run in the end one subdued at the point and no more.

[59] (P342.S2)
And the hilt must be well tempered, and have a good point, and the pommel must be heavy.

[60] (P342.S3)
And those points must be well-timed and well-sharpened.

[61] (P342.S4)
And the sword should be heavy behind, and light in front.

[62] (P342.S5)
And it wants to weigh from 5 to 6 pounds.

[63] (P342.S6)
And according to how the man is great and strong, so shall he arm himself.

[64] (P343.S0)
[ 35r-d ] ¶ This other sword is meant to cut all.

[65] (P343.S1)
Except that of the elbow at the end of the point, on both sides, in the middle of the third of the point, nothing should be cut, to such a distance that one hand with a wide glove can enter there.

[66] (P343.S2)
And likewise, it wishes to be the fine of the edge and of the point.

[67] (P343.S3)
And the hilt wants to be strong, and sharp and well tempered, and the pommel wants to be with a good point, and it wants to be heavy.
