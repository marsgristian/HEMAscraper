XXIIII.

[3] (P53.S2)
For whatever reason it may be: to achieve victory, the hand must be as ready for vengeance as the spirit is. In my opinion, every pomp and vain demonstration made with arms will be prejudicial to those who use it.

[4] (P53.S3)
Therefore, setting aside reasoning, I will continue to speak of the substance, as I have done until now.

[5] (P53.S4)
And concerning the spear, I say, if one makes a feint to the outside, towards the left side of the enemy, in order to provoke a parry, one must immediately disengage the weapon and thrust from the other side; if one makes the feint to the inside, one will disengage and strike to the outside: if from above, one will disengage and strike from below; if from below, one will disengage and strike from above.

[6] (P54.S0)
And if the opponent comes to thrust without parrying: the other, in exchange for evading, will parry and thrust, through the same path that the feint made: if from outside, parry, and thrust from outside: if from inside, parry, and thrust from inside: if from above, parry, and thrust from above: if from below, parry and thrust from below: moreover, he will be able to strike and thrust with a lunge from the side: and this from every side, from the right hand or from the left hand, holding the butt of the spear in that hand with which he will launch the weapon: and when his adversary does not thrust, he feigns, and thrusts, or feigns, counters, and thrusts.

[7] (P55.S0)
And if the enemy does not stop nor push, this at the hour after the feint, feint to strike, and push: therefore according to the feint, if he feints from outside, strike and push from outside; if he feints from inside, strike and push from inside: and thus for every direction.

[8] (P56.S0)
[ 61 ] And if the aforementioned were to find themselves as seen in the present act, although everyone would judge that the one of greater strength would have the advantage: nonetheless, one of lesser strength, by advancing and, while advancing, stopping to invite the enemy to push with all their might, and at the same time as the enemy pushes, by disarming them with a pull backward, and accompanying the enemy's force outward, could then go to invest in them, leaving the enemy's strike empty.

[9] (P57.S0)
And when they are also engaged together with the grips, and each one pulls to gain the advantage of the strike, the one of lesser strength pulling could go with the right foot next to the left, presenting the waist flat to the adversary, so that at that moment he yields and pushes against him, and suddenly turning back with the waist, he would accompany the enemy's weapon outwards, and by withdrawing his own, he would go to attack him, advancing with the left foot.

[10] (P57.S1)
And if indeed the greater force did not push, nor yield, but drew to itself: at the same time the lesser, passing to the left hand, would deliver a blow determined reasonably.
