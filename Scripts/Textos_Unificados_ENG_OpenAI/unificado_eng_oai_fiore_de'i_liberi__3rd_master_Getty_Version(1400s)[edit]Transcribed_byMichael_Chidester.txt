[1] (P156.S0)
[ 13v-b ] ¶ Here begin the plays of the reverse hand, through which countless have lost their lives.

[2] (P156.S1)
And my students will follow the plays, for the cover I make with the right hand.

[3] (P156.S2)
¶ This is a light play to perform in such a way that I wish to bring him down to the ground.

[4] (P157.S0)
For this way on the ground, you shall be set.

[5] (P157.S1)
And I would certainly do it better if I were well armed.

[6] (P157.S2)
That even unarmed you cannot do anything to me.

[7] (P157.S3)
And this would make you if you were even more powerful.

[8] (P158.S0)
[ 13v-d ] ¶ You go in the land and your arm is dislocated by the art of my master who is crowned.

[9] (P158.S1)
And no one against me can do anything.

[10] (P158.S2)
That here I hold you to make you endure more.

[11] (P159.S0)
[ 14r-a ] ¶ This is a grip which has neither contrary nor defense.

[12] (P159.S1)
And here I can take the dagger from you.

[13] (P159.S2)
And to bind you, it does not tire me.

[14] (P159.S3)
Dislocate the arm, and do not worry about me.

[15] (P159.S4)
To depart in such a way would be without my freedom.

[16] (P159.S5)
And I can ruin you, at my will.

[17] (P160.S0)
[ 14r-b ] ¶ The dagger you lost in such a way that I hold you.

[18] (P160.S1)
And taken from you the dagger, I can bind you.

[19] (P160.S2)
And in the binding below, I will make you struggle.

[20] (P160.S3)
That which is the key to the embrace,  
In that I wish to bind you.

[21] (P160.S4)
And whoever enters there cannot exit.

[22] (P160.S5)
For the great pain and suffering, he must endure.

[23] (P162.S0)
[ 14r-c ] ¶ This is called the lower bind and the strong key.

[24] (P162.S1)
that with such binding, armed and unarmed, one can deal death, which can wound in all places perilously.

[25] (P162.S2)
And such a binding cannot be escaped.

[26] (P162.S3)
And whoever enters it must do so with effort and struggle.

[27] (P162.S4)
I follow that which is seen in the depicted figure.

[28] (P163.S0)
[ 14r-d ] ¶ This is the counter of the third guard, which plays with the hand in the low position.

[29] (P163.S1)
I, having made this binding with him.

[30] (P163.S2)
Armed and unarmed, she is good and sure.

[31] (P163.S3)
And if an unarmed man grabs me in this way, I will damage his hands, and also I will untie his grip.

[32] (P163.S4)
And for sorrow  
beneath my feet I shall make him kneel.

[33] (P163.S5)
If I wish to strike him, I can do so well.
