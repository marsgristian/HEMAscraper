[ 119 ] OF THE DECEPTION.

[2] (P308.S0)
[ 137 ] OF THE GREAT SWORD.

[3] (P308.S1)
FOR the deceits and feints of the great sword, one must not have regard to using it more in single combat than among many, but one must solely have this aim of moving and employing it with agility and swiftness, both in cutting and thrusting, making those great turns and disarrays that its large form, size, and manner of holding require.

[4] (P309.S0)
One should not take into consideration the small or large turn, nor strike more with the point than with the edge, but only believe that victory lies in being swift and skillful in delivering blows in whatever manner one wishes. Therefore, many guards can be formed, of which it would be superfluous to discuss all; hence, we shall only treat of six, which are more convenient and more commonly used. Of these, one will be high, the second wide, and the third low, from which three others arise towards the other side, making a total of six.

[5] (P310.S0)
the high guard shall be held with the sword and the arms raised and wide from the body, with the sword pointed towards that side where the arm will have the hand at the cross, that is, if the right hand is at the cross and the right foot is forward, still hold the sword towards that side with the point.

[6] (P311.S0)
Another high guard opposite to this one shall be, without moving the feet, to turn the point towards the other side, that is, towards the left, and to cross the arms. And it must be noted that in this high guard, whichever side one desires, the sword should always be held with the point turned downwards.

[7] (P312.S0)
The second will be wide with the arms extended outward, not high but straight, and likewise the sword held straight; from this, another wide stance will form, turning towards the other side, crossing the arms.

[8] (P313.S0)
The third will be low, but in this position the sword must be held with the tip slightly upwards, and it will have its low counterpart by turning the sword to the other side and crossing the arms. Many other guards can be established, such as holding the sword high with the tip back to strike with a downward cut, or holding it low with the tip back to come up with an upward strike. However, these guards are poorly suited for feints, and if any feint should succeed in them, it would be a feint of cutting, which in the sword should be used in some manner, for much time is lost in this, as after those feints one must still strike with a cut, because it is not convenient with the sword to feign a cut and strike with the point, since the weight of the sword in cutting carries the arms away, making it difficult to hold for a thrust. Therefore, the feint that must be made with the sword should always be with the point, and to strike with the cut either straight or reverse, or to feign a high thrust and bring it low or to another place. And if one wishes to feign the cut, one must feign the false, and turn the round and strike with the cut, and while striking, always increase the step. And when this false feint is made, having the arms crossed, and after the feint one wishes to strike with the reverse, then one increases the left step, and finding oneself in any of the other guards without having the hands crossed, then wishing to increase to strike, one increases the right step. The same precautions should be taken regarding the increase, wishing in each of these guards to feign the point, which is the best feint one can make with the sword, and not for any other reason is the point feigned with the sword, and one strikes with the cut except that the cut has much more strength than the point, because the sword is long, which forms a great circle in cutting, and then, being of such weight, any little force makes it strike with great violence. But because this cutting strike is very insecure, as much time is lost in it, especially in the great circle of the sword, during which time any clever and quick person can strike with a sword or other weapon with the point, so to avoid this danger, before anyone resolves to strike with a cut, it is necessary first to thrust a point that is more quickly resolved than a feint, as much as one can extend both arms, with which one will have so much retraction from the enemy that...

[9] (P314.S0)
And it must be noted that when it happens that the cut after the feint goes wide, one should not allow oneself to be carried away by the weight of the sword, whether it be on the ground or leaving oneself exposed with the sword in front. Therefore, as soon as one realizes that one has struck in vain, one should let the sword go not fully around the head but with the point back from below, so that the turn brings it into high guard, from which one can immediately resolve to strike again or to defend against any desired attack, forming it according to what is most convenient in that situation.

[10] (P315.S0)
OF DEFENDING WITH THE BROADSWORD.

[11] (P315.S1)
The defenses of the great sword require a bold heart, for to withstand those great blows of the sword, one must not consider the advantage of time, which is the principal reason that men flee, knowing for certain that every moment of that is irreparable. Thus, when finding oneself against the enemy with another sword, one will always oppose the low guard, and coming with the feigned thrust, if it comes forward enough to reach, before it arrives, one must strike by immediately thrusting a point to the face or drawing down with the edge against the arms without raising the sword in a circle. However, because these feigned thrusts are most often distant and do not reach the target, they are drawn to frighten and make the opponent retreat, in order to then have time to deliver the cut with the increase of the step that comes with greater fury. From this, one can judge whether one can reach or not, depending on the proximity of the enemy, for one can very well extend the arms. Therefore, if one cannot reach, one should not care to strike but wait for him to bring the sword to deliver a cut, and at that time, grow and strike with the point.

[12] (P316.S0)
And it happens that one finds oneself against a great sword with only a sword or dagger, being certain that one can strike only with the point or with the edge. To defend against thrusts, one can parry and withdraw, but if it comes to a cut, as soon as the great sword is raised, one must then advance and strike with the point, or if there is not time to strike, meet and withstand the blow of the great sword in the initial phases, making a catch with one hand and striking with the other. And this must be done quickly, for in that moment the great sword has little strength.
