[1] (P31.S0)
[ 16r-a ] There are seven guards with your names. Each of you shall demonstrate on your side. Philippo di Vadi of Pisa.

[2] (P32.S0)
[ 16v-a ] I am a door of iron, flat and earthly, That cuts and thrusts, always restraining itself. [ 16v-b ] I am a position of the proud and lofty falcon, To make defense in every manner.

[3] (P33.S0)
[ 17r-a ] I am the position of the true window Remove from the art the left thing [ 17r-b ] I am the crown and I am made master Of bindings I find myself right

[4] (P34.S0)
[ 17v-a ] I am placed frontally, so secure, Of cuts and thrusts, I shall never take care [ 17v-b ] I am positioned like a wild boar, and I am outside, That I shall never delay in striking.

[5] (P35.S0)
[ 18r-a ] To take you by the arm, I will give you a cut or a pommel, a treat I shall bestow upon you.

[6] (P36.S0)
[ 18v-a ] I have you, turned upside down, bound by a sword strike; you will be brought low.

[7] (P37.S0)
[ 19r-a ] For such a time that I have given my sword halfway across the throat, I believe I have cut it.

[8] (P38.S0)
[ 19v-a ] With my sword I do not wish to make war, But with yours I shall bring you to the ground.

[9] (P39.S0)
[ 20r-a ] With skill I have placed you in such an act, to make Faroti fall to the ground at the first stroke.

[10] (P40.S0)
[ 20v-a ] By this turn of the pommel, I have bound you, and suddenly, if I wish, I have brought you down.

[11] (P41.S0)
[ 21r-a ] For the strike given to my sword, I shall hit you on the arm over the head.

[12] (P42.S0)
[ 21v-a ] This is a grip that I make from the outside. I shall strike you with it at the first blow.

[13] (P43.S0)
[ 22r-a ] For the time that my support has given you, Chascar, I shall make you lie prostrate on the ground.

[14] (P44.S0)
[ 22v-a ] I made the sight to deliver a downward strike, to cut the mask with the teeth.

[15] (P45.S0)
[ 23r-a ] This is a hold that I make you within. You will go to the ground as I feel.

[16] (P46.S0)
From the half-slice I parry your sword, From my pommel you shall have a good thrust.
