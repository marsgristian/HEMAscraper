[1] (P261.S0)
The sword is against every weapon such that neither spear nor axe nor dagger can prevail against it.

[2] (P261.S1)
Long and short 
I can make.

[3] (P261.S2)
And I tighten and come to the close play, and I come to the tower of the sword and to embrace my art. 
If there are breaks and bindings, I know well how to cover and strike, always aiming to finish where I want; 
whoever acts against me, I shall make them languish well.

[4] (P261.S3)
And I am Royal and maintain Justice, I increase goodness and destroy malice.

[5] (P261.S4)
Whoever guards me while I make my crosses, in fact, by arming them, I will give them fame and voice.

[6] (P262.S0)
[ 25r-c ] ¶ Here begins the play of the sword with two hands, wide play.

[7] (P262.S1)
This master who is here crossed with this player at the point of the sword says that when I am crossed at the point of the sword, I immediately turn my sword and strike him from the other side with a downward cut to the head and arms, or I thrust him in the face, as you can see depicted here above.

[8] (P263.S0)
I have placed a point in the turn as the master who is in front says.

[9] (P263.S1)
I could still have done what he says, that is, to have drawn from my sword immediately here where I was after crossing to the right side.

[10] (P263.S2)
On the other side of the room, I must turn my sword in a downward strike for the head and for the arms, as my master has instructed me before.

[11] (P264.S0)
[ 25v-a ] ¶ Here I anchor myself in the wide play with the half sword.

[12] (P264.S1)
And as soon as I am crossed, I let my sword run over his hands, and if I wish to pass with my foot straight out of the way, I can put a point in his chest, as I have drawn and depicted here.

[13] (P265.S0)
[ 25v-b ] ¶ The play of my master is this: I have completed it, for I have made its cover, and immediately I have performed its action, for I have struck first at the arms, and then I have placed the point in the chest.

[14] (P266.S0)
[ 25v-c ] ¶ And my master who is before me has taught me that when I am in the half-sword with a crossed opponent, I must immediately advance, and take his sword in this manner to strike him with a cut or a thrust.

[15] (P266.S1)
Moreover, I can damage his leg in such a way that he may see here that I intend to strike him with my foot above the thigh of the leg or below the knee.

[16] (P267.S0)
[ 25v-d ] ¶ The scholar who is before me speaks of his master and mine, who has taught him this game, and by virtue of this, I do it.

[17] (P267.S1)
To do it without a doubt, it has little difficulty for me.

[18] (P268.S0)
[ 26r-a ] ¶ This play is called the peasant's strike and it is such that one must await the peasant who brings it with his sword.

[19] (P268.S1)
And that which the strike awaits is to be in a small step with the foot weary in front.

[20] (P268.S2)
And immediately when the peasant tries to strike you, raise the sword out of the way towards the right side, and as he strikes, pass to the cross out of the way, taking his blow in the middle of your sword.

[21] (P268.S3)
And let his sword rest on the ground, and immediately respond to him with a strike to the head or to the arms, or with the point to the chest as depicted.

[22] (P268.S4)
Also, this play is good with the sword against the axe, and against a heavy or light staff.

[23] (P269.S0)
[ 26r-b ] ¶ Here I declare the strike of the peasant, which he well places the point in the chest.

[24] (P269.S1)
And thus he could deliver a strike to the head and to the arms with the descending blow as I have said before.

[25] (P269.S2)
If the player wanted to strike me with a thrust beneath my arms, I would immediately increase the pressure on the tired one, and place my sword upon his.

[26] (P269.S3)
and I cannot do nothing.

[27] (P270.S0)
When one traps you by the leg, disengage the foot that is in front.

[28] (P270.S1)
Or you turn it around.

[29] (P270.S2)
and strikes downward 
to his head as I depict here.

[30] (P270.S3)
Even though with a sword of two hands, one should not draw from the knee upwards.

[31] (P270.S4)
For it is too great and for the danger to those who are among it.

[32] (P270.S5)
That which remains completely uncovered is what is between the legs.

[33] (P270.S6)
Unless one were to be struck in the ground, one could indeed draw well for the leg.

[34] (P270.S7)
But in no other way, being sword against sword.

[35] (P271.S0)
[ 26r-d ] ¶ This strike that I deliver to you with my foot in the groin, I do to cause you pain and to make you lose your cover.

[36] (P271.S1)
That by doing this play, one wishes to be done immediately, for I have no doubt of the contrary.

[37] (P271.S2)
The contrary of this play wishes to be quickly done, that is, the player must take the scholar by the right leg with his weary hand, and throw him to the ground.

[38] (P272.S0)
[ 26v-a ] ¶ This play is called exchanging the point and is done in such a way.

[39] (P272.S1)
When one thrusts at you with a point.

[40] (P272.S2)
Suddenly raise your foot so that it is out of the way, and with the other foot step across, also out of the way, crossing your sword with your low arms, and with the point of your sword raised towards the face or the chest as I have depicted.

[41] (P273.S0)
[ 26v-b ] ¶ And of this exchange of thrusts that I have before me, this is the play: as soon as the student before me does not place the point in the face of the player, and leaves it so that he does not place it either in the face or in the chest, and because the player is armored, immediately the student should, with the tired foot, pass forward, and in this manner he should take him.

[42] (P273.S1)
And his sword must strike well after the player has taken his sword and cannot flee.

[43] (P274.S0)
[ 26v-c ] ¶ This is another defense that is made against the thrust when one is thrust at, as I have told you in the exchange of thrusts in the second play that I have presented to you, which must be increased and passed off the line.

[44] (P274.S1)
Thus it is to be done in this play, except that the exchange of points goes with the point and with the arms low and with the point raised of the sword as previously stated.

[45] (P274.S2)
But this is called breaking with the point, for the student goes with his arms raised and takes the downward strike with the increase and passes outside of the path and, crossing, the point almost to the middle of the sword to deflect it to the ground.

[46] (P274.S3)
And immediately he comes to the grips.

[47] (P275.S0)
[ 26v-d ] ¶ The student who is before me has rebuffed the sword of the player to the ground.

[48] (P275.S1)
And I complete his play in this manner.

[49] (P275.S2)
When he strikes his sword to the ground, I forcefully place my foot straight upon his sword.

[50] (P275.S3)
Either I break it, or I take it in such a way that it can no longer be cared for.

[51] (P275.S4)
And this is not enough for me, that as soon as I place it above the sword, I strike him with the false edge of my sword under the beard at the neck.

[52] (P275.S5)
And immediately I return with the descending strike of my sword for the arms or for the hands as I have depicted.

[53] (P276.S0)
[ 27r-a ] ¶ Here begins this play of the thrust break, which is the second play that I present to you.

[54] (P276.S1)
For when I parry the sword to the ground, I immediately strike with my right foot upon his sword.

[55] (P276.S2)
And in that strike, I hit him in the head as you will see.

[56] (P277.S0)
[ 27r-b ] ¶ This is also another play of the breaking of the point, that if the player, in breaking, has broken his point, raises his sword to cover mine, I immediately place the hilt of my sword inside the part of his right arm near his right hand, and immediately I take my sword with my left hand near the point, and strike the player in the head.

[57] (P277.S1)
And if I wished, I would place it around his neck to sever the throat's canal.

[58] (P278.S0)
[ 27r-c ] ¶ And when I, having parried the point or truly crossed with a player, place my right hand upon his right elbow, I press strongly so that I make him turn and uncover, and then I strike him in that turn that I make him perform.

[59] (P279.S0)
[ 27r-d ] ¶ This scholar who is before me speaks the truth that for the turn he makes you take, by this manner he will come to cut your head.

[60] (P279.S1)
Before you could return to cover, I could strike you in the back with the point and leave you with an open wound.

[61] (P280.S0)
[ 27v-a ] ¶ This play is called false point and short point, and I will describe how I do it.

[62] (P280.S1)
I show how to come with great force to strike the player with a middle blow to the head.

[63] (P280.S2)
And as soon as he makes the cover, I strike his sword lightly.

[64] (P280.S3)
And suddenly I turned my sword to the other side, taking my sword with my hand almost to the middle.

[65] (P280.S4)
And I immediately place the point in his throat or in his chest.

[66] (P280.S5)
And it is better this play in arms than without.

[67] (P281.S0)
[ 27v-b ] ¶ This is the contrary of the play that I have shown before, namely the false thrust or the short thrust.

[68] (P281.S1)
And this contrary is done in such a way.

[69] (P281.S2)
When the student strikes with his sword, in the moment he turns with his sword, I immediately turn with my sword in the same manner that he turns with his.

[70] (P281.S3)
Unless I pass to the cross to find the companion more uncovered.

[71] (P281.S4)
And if I place the point in his turn.

[72] (P281.S5)
And this is against me, both in arms and without.

[73] (P282.S0)
[ 27v-c ] ¶ Here ends the wide play of the sword with two hands, which are united plays that have plays, that is remedies against the right side, and against the reverse side.

[74] (P282.S1)
and against thrusts and against cuts of the sword, with covered openings, striking and bindings, that all these things can be understood very easily.
