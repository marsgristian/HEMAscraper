[1] (P73.S0)
[ 53 ] OF THE WAY TO PARRY THE THRUST, WHICH COMES to the face from the right side of the Sword and Dagger.

[2] (P73.S1)
TO achieve the effect of the present figure, it is necessary to stand in guard, as you will understand: I say it is essential to be in the proper stance, strong, keeping the weapons ready to parry and strike, with the dagger at the guard of the enemy's sword, and your sword ready to strike, wherever it will be most advantageous; and if you see that your enemy wishes to stab you in the face, parry with the edge of the dagger, and at the same time strike the enemy in the right shoulder, for doing so at once is difficult to parry.

[3] (P73.S2)
And to achieve the effect that one cannot be countered, it is not enough to merely know these things; one must also know how to put them into effect, that is, at the same time to stand strong in guard, with the right foot forward, the left foot firmly on the ground supporting all your life, keeping the back foot as in a variation to be able to advance willingly forward, and backward according to the occasion, always keeping the point of your sword aimed at the face or chest of the enemy, and the dagger raised, in proportion to the enemy's sword, leaning rather the body back than forward, standing with a keen and alert eye, with a bold heart, without fearing the enemy in the least.

[4] (P73.S3)
And if (while you are in this guard) your enemy were to thrust at you, or aim for your face; you shall then, parrying with the edge of the dagger, simultaneously deliver a thrust, which will have the effect of the figure.

[5] (P73.S4)
But be warned to parry strongly and securely, and to turn your head and body slightly, and while he strikes at you, you shall then, while parrying vigorously, simultaneously deliver your thrust.

[6] (P73.S5)
Because if you stopped first, and then wanted to strike, you could not; for your enemy would pull back the arm and the body, and would be in time to parry; and you would be in danger of your life.

[7] (P73.S6)
But if you parry and strike at the same time, you will deliver the thrust while he comes forward, beneath the side of the sword, which, if you execute it correctly and in time, is difficult to defend against; taking care how you have delivered the thrust, keep your rear foot firm and strong on the ground, and as soon as you have executed it, you will draw back your life, stepping out of measure.

[8] (P74.S0)
To return safely backward, you must, once you have pulled, first bring your head back, and then your waist, for then the leg will follow by itself; because if you were to pull the leg back first, the head would go forward, and you would be in danger of your life; and you would not be able to return out of measure; for pulling a long and strong thrust, and not knowing how to return backward with the waist, is of no value.

[9] (P75.S0)
And to achieve the effect of the figure, it is necessary to practice, for while you see that your enemy wishes to strike; you strike at that moment, for your thrust will arrive before his, even if he is the first to strike.

[10] (P76.S0)
[ 55 ] THE TRUE WAY TO PARRY THE THRUST, WHICH COMES TO THE LEFT SIDE.

[11] (P76.S1)
IN THE present figure, one must position oneself as in the one above; if your enemy intends to strike you in the flank, you will hold your dagger in guard against his sword: and at the moment he strikes, you will parry with the edge of the dagger and wound the enemy on the shoulder of his sword at the same time, rather drawing yours more swiftly than he draws his thrust, being attentive with the eye and with the mind, focused on the waist; and at the moment you see that he wishes to strike his, you will thrust yours into the shoulder and parry his at that time, so that he will not be able to parry yours: for you will strike at the moment he comes forward, as can be seen in the figure.

[12] (P76.S2)
After delivering the thrust, step back out of measure, in the same manner as the first figure of Sword and Dagger.

[13] (P77.S0)
[ 57 ] OF THE WAY TO PARRY A THRUST THAT COMES TO THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE SWORD AND DAGGER.

[14] (P77.S1)
In this figure, as you see, if you were in this guard just as described above, and your enemy were to approach you with a low sword strike, aiming to wound you in the right side, you must raise the arm of your sword and hold it in third guard to thrust with the point of your sword towards his face or chest, and with the dagger somewhat lowered, with the arm in guard against the enemy's sword.

[15] (P77.S2)
And as the enemy thrusts the point into your side, you parry, and strike with a thrust into the shoulder of the enemy's sword at the same time that you parry, and you will see the effect of the figure.

[16] (P77.S3)
Indeed, it would be better, as you see your enemy wanting to thrust, to advance your own, for you will more easily wound him; and immediately after delivering the thrust, or the hit, retreat out of measure.

[17] (P78.S0)
These are the four kinds of striking and parrying of thrusts and cuts, and all go in the same manner, that is to say, parrying and striking at the same time; and in the movement of the feet, always be mindful, as you deliver the thrust, to advance slightly with the right foot, keeping the left foot firmly on the ground.

[18] (P78.S1)
Beware, for it may seem difficult at first to hold the left foot firmly on the ground, but with practice it will become easy for you.

[19] (P79.S0)
[ 59 ] OF THE WAY TO PARRY THE POINT OF THE SWORD, AND DAGGER TO THE FACE.

[20] (P79.S1)
To put into effect all that is demonstrated for this figure, it is necessary that you remain in this very guard, and seeing the enemy coming to thrust at your face; by parrying with the edge of the Dagger, you will push the thrust into his side at the same time that you execute this action.

[21] (P79.S2)
However, beware, when you see the tip of the enemy's sword near your face, to keep the Dagger somewhat away from it, giving it space to strike you: and when it strikes, you will parry with the Dagger, and you will turn your head slightly to pull away from his sword: and at the moment you parry, you will stab him in the side, which will be exposed, and the closest to wound.

[22] (P79.S3)
As soon as you have struck, you will retreat in the manner described.

[23] (P80.S0)
[ 61 ] OF THE MANNER OF PARRYING THE STRIKE TO THE HEAD WITH SWORD AND DAGGER.

[24] (P80.S1)
From this figure, you learn how to parry the knife strikes aimed at the head with the dagger: You must assume the guard of the first lesson; and if your enemy were to strike you with a knife to the head, meet him with your dagger edge-on, and at the same time, thrust the point towards the enemy's face, and advance slightly with your right foot forward: Perform these three actions together, and you will see the effect of the figure.

[25] (P80.S2)
It would be better for a great knife thrust, should it come, to make it die, than to have half the strength.

[26] (P80.S3)
While your enemy raises the sword to deliver the thrust, strike him with your thrust to the face, for he will need to pull his head back somewhat, and he will close his eyes, and you will take the strength out of the thrust.

[27] (P80.S4)
To achieve this effect, it is necessary to be bold, to have no fear of the sword, nor of the enemy; to know how to parry well with the dagger; to know how to deliver a straight and long thrust well; and to take care not to parry the knife strike with the flat of the Dagger, for if it were a strong knife strike, it would throw the Dagger from your hand and wound you on the head.

[28] (P80.S5)
But if you parry with the edge, keeping your arm extended, there is no danger.

[29] (P80.S6)
Having drawn the point, you will retreat beyond measure, as stated above.

[30] (P81.S0)
[ 63 ] OF THE WAY TO PARRY A THRUST WITH THE DAGGER.

[31] (P81.S1)
From this figure, one learns how to parry a reverse strike that comes towards the face: One must assume the guard of the first lesson with the Dagger held high and firm; and as you see the reverse coming, you should meet it with the edge of the Dagger, and at the same time step forward slightly with your right foot, delivering the thrust to the exposed side, which you will see revealed, and you will observe the effect of the figure.

[32] (P82.S0)
It should be noted that these six lessons are the most important and the most beautiful that can be found in the Art of Fencing: but one must hold the Dagger firmly, and as you see the sword coming towards you, both point and edge, you should meet it with the Dagger, and at that very moment deliver the thrust, where the enemy will be exposed.

[33] (P83.S0)
[ 65 ] THRUSTS STRUCK TO THE CHEST WITH SWORD AND DAGGER.

[34] (P83.S1)
The first part that one must have, who delights in the profession of arms, is to know how to approach the enemy, deliver a thrust, and return to guard out of measure.

[35] (P83.S2)
To want to do this, it is necessary to have knowledge of the opposite guards, and to know how to thrust, where you will see that your enemy is exposed; for if he were a little exposed in the chest, you must go to close in slowly, with the sword low, keeping the point towards the chest of the enemy; and with the dagger at the guard of his sword, and as you are in measure, you will first strike with the sword, then the body, and after that the foot, for you will see the effect of this figure.

[36] (P83.S3)
Because if you extend the arm of the sword, and then you thrust at the chest with the waist, he will not notice it.

[37] (P83.S4)
You would do the opposite if you moved the body first and then thrust; for he would notice it and could parry, and respond at the same time, and at that moment you would be in danger.

[38] (P83.S5)
Immediately after you have delivered the thrust, you will withdraw out of measure, standing in guard with your weapons ready to defend and to strike, for the enemy, seeing himself wounded, will be disconcerted in attacking you, either with a thrust or a cut; at that moment, you will parry and strike at the same time, as is described in the first six figures.

[39] (P83.S6)
But the importance of this figure lies in knowing how to return out of measure after having struck; and to return safely, it is necessary, as has been said above, to first pull back the head, which will bring the body and the leg, for if you were to pull back the leg first, you would be in danger, either of falling or of your enemy wounding you: for the head would go forward; so this is one of the principal things that you should learn.

[40] (P84.S0)
[67] TO STRIKE THE THRUST, WHILE THE ENEMY MOVES.

[41] (P84.S1)
In the Art of Fencing, the main things are to know the measure and the time, of which we shall reason in this figure.

[42] (P84.S2)
As you have the sword in hand, and you go against your enemy, approach him with a keen eye, with your weapons ready to parry and to strike.

[43] (P84.S3)
At that time, be aware if he wishes to be the first to strike, or not.

[44] (P84.S4)
And if you see that he wishes to be the first; give him time to strike; and you, meanwhile, going to the guard, will strike him at the same time, as above.

[45] (P84.S5)
But if you see that he fears you, and that he stands on guard to wait, slowly approach him from the side where he is uncovered; and as you are in measure, holding the Dagger before the guard of his sword, you will first strike at the point, then at the waist, and afterwards at the foot, always keeping the Dagger in front, so that if the enemy strikes at the same time, you may parry, so that it would not be a clash, and strike you both.

[46] (P84.S6)
Having drawn, step back out of measure in the manner described.

[47] (P84.S7)
And because it is necessary that when you go to grapple him, he must do one of these three things: either he pulls, or he stands still to parry; or he moves either to one side or the other to evade, it is essential that if he pulls, or if he stands still when you are in measure, you act in the manner described in this present lesson.

[48] (P84.S8)
But if he moves, either retreats or goes this way, or that way, or in any manner; you strike him hard, and quickly with the thrust, while he keeps his foot in motion.

[49] (P84.S9)
Because while he moves, he cannot wound you at the time that you strike.

[50] (P84.S10)
Then return outside of measure as usual.

[51] (P85.S0)
[ 69 ] POINT DRAWN ABOVE THE DAGGER.

[52] (P85.S1)
To attempt to deliver a thrust to one who holds the Dagger low, it is necessary (as seen in this figure) to close in from the side of the Dagger; and as you come within measure, you will first draw the Sword, and then the body, by raising somewhat the hilt of the hand, as you see in the figure, which will achieve the effect.

[53] (P85.S2)
Then you will return to the manner described of the ..... figure.

[54] (P86.S0)
[71] There are many guards that can be made, for every way of holding the sword is a guard, as has been said: and all the guards are good to those who know how to recognize the time and the measure: and he who knows how to make guards with skill in war will always deceive the enemy.

[55] (P87.S0)
ARTIFICIAL GUARD OF REVEALING THE LEFT SIDE.

[56] (P87.S1)
The Guards with artifice are infinite; but in this my first book, I shall present only three, which will serve as a light and a path for those who wish to create as many guards as they desire.

[57] (P88.S0)
These guards of artifice are for learned men, who have knowledge of timing and measure, and who have good practice, for in these guards many things can be done, especially in this first one, one can approach to engage the enemy; and as you are in measure, waiting, you can strike him in that part which is uncovered; and if he were to pull back, you could do many things: such as parrying and striking at the same time; parrying and making a feint, a thrust, or everything that you know how to do in other guards, in which you are trained.

[58] (P88.S1)
And if your enemy, standing in guard, were to strike disconcerted; you defend, and strike at the same time, or disconcerted, and immediately retreat out of measure.

[59] (P88.S2)
This guard deceives many, both those who know and those who do not know how to play with arms; for seeing you uncovered, they will strike at that exposed part; and you, easily parrying and hitting in the manner described above in the first lessons of Sword and Dagger, will give them a sure and easy blow.

[60] (P89.S0)
[ 73 ] ARTIFICIAL GUARD OF REVEALING THE RIGHT SIDE.

[61] (P89.S1)
THIS is another artificial guard, as you see, which leaves the entire right side exposed: and the rest of the body is completely covered, so that the enemy cannot strike, except from the uncovered right shoulder; but you can parry with the Sword, or with the Dagger, as you wish, and you can strike from a firm foot, or step forward with your foot, as it suits you.

[62] (P90.S0)
[ 75 ] ARTIFICIAL GUARD OF UNCOVERING THE CHEST.

[63] (P90.S1)
In this other guard, where the chest is exposed, it is so that your enemy cannot wound you, neither from the side of the sword nor from that of the dagger, for when he comes to strike you, he will aim for the chest, being the only part uncovered.

[64] (P90.S2)
While you strike, you parry, and wound at the same time, either in the right shoulder or in the face, these being the closest targets.

[65] (P90.S3)
You can also in this guard make feints, pass with the foot, and all that you have learned in the other guards.

[66] (P90.S4)
It is also good with those who strike resolutely, and who do not make feints.

[67] (P90.S5)
But with those who have timing and measure, and who know how to deliver a decisive thrust and a feint well, it is not to be used, but rather to close in with the weapons and seek to cover the enemy's sword out of measure, where you can parry and strike securely, according to the opportunity.

[68] (P91.S0)
[ 77 ] OF THE FEINT WITH THE SWORD, AND DAGGER, TO STRIKE ABOVE THE DAGGER.

[69] (P91.S1)
Just as the knowledge of time and measure is the principal foundation of fencing, so the Cavation and the Feint are its adornment.

[70] (P91.S2)
The Cavation consists entirely in the knot of the hand: The Feint is the showing of doing one thing, and not doing it.

[71] (P91.S3)
One cannot feign without a disengagement.

[72] (P92.S0)
I cannot speak of the Feint without including the Cavation.

[73] (P92.S1)
The Feint is a deadly deception, and almost irreparable to those of valor, and masters of this science, and without a doubt, to those who have no knowledge of it.

[74] (P92.S2)
This is done in this way: sometimes to deliver a thrust above the Dagger to the chest, or to the face of the enemy, one must do thus, tighten it with the sword low beneath the Dagger, keeping your Dagger in guard against his Sword, and as you find yourselves in measure, deliver a decisive Thrust, and then retreat: and if you pursue him; nothing more will be needed: but if he parries, you return to tighten, and as you are in measure, thrust the Point without extending the step, remaining with your body firm beneath the Dagger.

[75] (P92.S3)
And while the enemy approaches to parry against her, as he lowers the Dagger, you, raising the tip of the Sword with the turn of the hand's knot, extending your step and your waist at that moment, will strike him, either in the chest or in the face, which he surely does not perceive, as you see in the Figure.

[76] (P92.S4)
In order for it to have effect, it must be done with great swiftness, so that it is not known whether it is resolved or feigned.

[77] (P92.S5)
And take heed, that in going with the point of the Sword over the enemy's Dagger, you should walk with the hollow; so that having hollowed, and struck, may be at the same time.

[78] (P92.S6)
Then you will return out of measure, as above, ensuring yourself from the enemy's Sword.

[79] (P93.S0)
[ 79 ] OF THE FEINT WITH THE SWORD AND DAGGER, TO STRIKE IN THE CHEST.

[80] (P93.S1)
THIS Feint is not different from the previous one, except that the former strikes above the Dagger, while this one strikes below, which is done with the same rules as the other.

[81] (P93.S2)
In this you must hold the sword high; and tight, that you will have the enemy, you will thrust a Point above the Dagger, raising somewhat more the arm of the tip of the Sword, which manner of striking is called Slitting the Dagger.

[82] (P93.S3)
If he does not stop; there is no need to do anything else; but if he does stop, you must present him with the point, neither more nor less, standing firm with your stance and foot; and while he goes to parry, you, walking with the point of the sword under the guard of the dagger; turning the knot of your hand, and extending your step, you will wound him in the chest, and he will not notice it.

[83] (P93.S4)
Then you will retreat out of measure, ensuring yourself as above.

[84] (P94.S0)
[ 81 ] OF THE FEINT OF THE SWORD, AND DAGGER IN THE FACE Digging the Sword over the tip of the Dagger.

[85] (P94.S1)
To want to deliver a thrust to the face of your enemy at the first opportunity, one must perform this feint: which, as it is the most difficult, is also the most beautiful.

[86] (P94.S2)
One must therefore press the enemy on the side of the Sword, keeping the point of the Sword towards his face from the right; waiting to see if he wishes to strike, or if he wants to remain in guard to defend, and if he is in guard, feign a thrust at his face, and as he steps forward with the dagger in obedience, you with the knot of your hand, turning the point of the Sword over the point of the enemy's Dagger, will wound him, for he will not notice, since in defending he will expose himself completely.

[87] (P94.S3)
Given that you will have the point, you will do as above.

[88] (P95.S0)
[ 83 ] OF PARING THE LONG THRUST WITH THE SWORD, WITH THE CARRYING of the life backward.

[89] (P95.S1)
And it is thus of such importance to be a good parrier, that I hold that knowing how to parry well is of the greatest importance in this profession.

[90] (P95.S2)
Now in three ways I want to teach you to defend yourself from long thrusts.

[91] (P95.S3)
You will stand in guard as described above with the Sword, and with the body forward, keeping the chest somewhat exposed, and you will stand either at measure or out of measure.

[92] (P95.S4)
But not within measure, and being in measure, you should see that there is a thrust, and you, pulling your life back, should parry with the Sword, as you see in the Figure, and at that very moment (because by retreating, you save yourself from the point of the enemy's Sword, keeping it at a distance so that it does not reach you) he, lowering with his life downwards, puts himself in disorder, and it is difficult to parry, hence you will be able, by extending your step, to wound him, and you can save yourself from him, as above, taking care that while you parry or retreat, to stay firm on your feet.

[93] (P96.S0)
[ 85 ] OF PARRYING WITH THE DAGGER WHILE RETREATING.

[94] (P96.S1)
STAND in the same guard as above, with your waist forward with artifice, holding the Dagger against the guard of the enemy's Sword, and as you see the point coming towards you, you will at the same time parry with the dagger, and you will pull your waist back, withdrawing the leg in front, keeping the Sword ready to strike, as you see in the Figure, where standing with strong feet, and the Sword free, you can do many things before he returns to guard, since by extending and falling with the waist, he will give you the opportunity to do so.

[95] (P97.S0)
[ 87 ] OF PARRYING WITH THE DAGGER WHILE RETREATING, AND striking with the Sword at the same time.

[96] (P97.S1)
IF as in the first two Figures one fights with the Dagger, bringing the life behind, and then strikes: which show two times, one in parrying, and the other in striking: so with this other Figure of mine I demonstrate how one parries and strikes at the same time.

[97] (P97.S2)
The reason for this bringing back of the waist is that you disconcert the enemy, and you see your own actions better.

[98] (P97.S3)
Now, therefore, you will place yourself in the same guard above with the Sword and Dagger, with your body bent forward, and when you are within measure, let yourself be drawn in, and as he draws you; you must do three things at once; that is, Parry with the Dagger; pull your body back, drawing the front foot equal to the back one, remaining bent with the body, and extend your arm, thrusting the point into his chest: this method of parrying and striking deceives the enemy so much that it is impossible for him to defend himself.

[99] (P97.S4)
After this, you will return out of measure, and you will assure yourself, as has been said.

[100] (P98.S0)
[ 89 ] OF THE POINT IN THE FACE, STOPPING WITH THE SWORD.

[101] (P98.S1)
In this figure, a firm point of the foot is demonstrated, very useful and beautiful for those who know how to put it into practice and will exercise it: it is done in this way.

[102] (P98.S2)
If your enemy wishes to thrust a stab at your face, or a straight point, by parrying with your Sword, you will direct the point at the enemy's face at the same time, such that he will not be able to parry it in the same moment with the Dagger, while you strike at the time he thrusts.

[103] (P98.S3)
Because if he wishes to parry with the Dagger, he will strike it against his sword, and remain with the point in his face.

[104] (P99.S0)
This lesson teaches not to strike at the face, for if you were to aim for the chest, he could parry it with the dagger.

[105] (P99.S1)
And to perform it with artifice, which will also deceive those who know; it is necessary to expose the left side, and keep the Dagger low, giving the enemy the opportunity to strike either at the face or above the Dagger, believing that you will parry with the Dagger, while at the same time you will parry with the strong of your Sword, and you will advance with your right foot, keeping the point of your Sword towards the face, for if he wishes to parry, he will clash against his own Sword, which he cannot parry nor wound, as shown in the Figure.

[106] (P99.S2)
Pull the point back out of measure, as above.

[107] (P100.S1)
The approach to grappling and striking with the dagger is done in many ways, and according to the occasions in which one finds oneself.

[108] (P100.S2)
Many engage in grappling, who cannot do otherwise, according to how furious the enemy is in advancing: Others pass through anger, who have no patience to play at the tip of the Sword.

[109] (P100.S3)
Others pass with artifice to wound with the Dagger.

[110] (P100.S4)
In this my first book, I will write only a passage with artifice to wound securely with the Dagger; and that your enemy may not be able to offend you either with the Sword or with the Dagger.

[111] (P100.S5)
The aforementioned pass is made in this manner.

[112] (P100.S6)
One must take guard in such a way that the entire right side remains exposed, and give the enemy the opportunity to strike decisively, whether with a thrust or a cut; at that moment, you will parry with your Sword, and stepping forward, you will strongly confront his with your Sword, and you will place your Sword in the arm of his Dagger, as you see in the figure, for your enemy will not be able to move either the Sword or the Dagger, and then you will be able to give him as many stabs as you wish.

[113] (P100.S7)
This lesson, to whomever shall have practiced it, is very safe.

[114] (P101.S0)
[ 93 ] OF THE POINT OF THE SWORD, AND DAGGER DRAWN FROM THE SIDE of the right shoulder.

[115] (P101.S1)
A MAN who wishes to be skilled in this profession shall never take guard, but rather, standing outside of measure, he will consider the guard of the enemy, and will gradually approach to close in on the open place; and when he is within measure, he will strike in the manner of the present Figure, in which the right shoulder is exposed, being careful to close in from the side of the enemy's sword; and if he sees that the enemy is in guard, waiting to counter; he will deliver a strong thrust as described, turning the knot of the hand from the side of the enemy's sword, as can be seen.

[116] (P101.S2)
Then, after delivering the thrust, you will return outside of measure as mentioned above.

[117] (P102.S0)
[ 95 ] OF PASSING WITH THE SWORD FOOT AND DAGGER.

[118] (P102.S1)
THIS Figure serves no other purpose than as a demonstration that I make in this my first book: but in the others, which I shall send forth, God willing, I will treat of the passes of Sword and Dagger, that is to say, passing with the foot, since in this I do not address anything other than the firm foot; for all that is done with a firm foot, knowing how to take the time, can be done with a pass of the foot.

[119] (P103.S0)
But if the enemy draws the Sword, one must follow it with the Dagger, and in the meantime strike with the Sword, and as you have given the thrusts you desire, you will retreat out of measure, for one who knows how to take the time well, and who steps forward with the foot, and does not know how to draw the Sword, can be said to know nothing.

[120] (P103.S1)
Since passing, even if wounded, one finds oneself in danger, considering that the enemy will still want to make their strike; for there are those brave souls who, even when injured, still wish to take their revenge; and thus, in their fury, they strike with all their might; so that you too might end up wounded, or even dead.

[121] (P103.S2)
And although, passing your enemy, you have parried the thrust, you would find yourself in great danger if you did not know how to draw the sword, and did not know how to fight in half-sword, as you see in the Figure, and be able to retreat and save yourself, as I shall explain in these other books of mine, God willing.

[122] (P104.S0)
THE END.
