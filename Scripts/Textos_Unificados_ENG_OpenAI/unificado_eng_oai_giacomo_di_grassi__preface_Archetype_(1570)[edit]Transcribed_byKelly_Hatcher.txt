[21] (P4.S0)
[ iii ] TO THE READERS.

[22] (P4.S1)
IF, as from the bands, we carry with us an almost unrestrained desire for knowledge, so from being made reasonable arises within us a laudable and ardent wish to teach; which, were it not so, one might not see the world filled with so many arts and sciences.

[23] (P5.S0)
Therefore, since not all men are suited for the contemplation and investigation of things, nor is the grace granted by God to each one to be able to lift their mind from the earth, and by investigating find the causes of things, and share them with those who are less willing to toil; it would happen that a part of men, like lords and masters, would dominate, and the others, like most vile servants, would endure a life unworthy of the human condition in perpetual darkness.

[24] (P5.S1)
Therefore, in my opinion, it is reasonable to make others partakers of that which has been found through much study and labor in investigation.

[25] (P5.S2)
Being therefore, since childhood, greatly delighted by the handling of arms, after having exercised my body in them for a long time, I wished to see the most excellent masters of this art, whom I have observed to have all very different ways of teaching, almost as if this craft were without order and rule, and depended entirely on the brain and whims of those who practice it. Nor was it possible in this honorable exercise to find, as in all other arts and sciences, a single good and true way, by means of which one could have complete knowledge of all that can be done with arms, without wearing out the brain every day learning one strike from one master, tomorrow from another, exhausting oneself around the particulars, the knowledge of which is infinite, and therefore impossible.

[26] (P5.S3)
However, driven by an honest desire to play, I devoted myself entirely to this contemplation, with the hope that I might be able to uncover the principles and true causes of this art, and to reduce the confused and infinite number of strikes into a concise summary and certain order: these principles being few, and therefore easy for anyone to understand and retain in memory; without any doubt, in a short time and with little effort, they will open a very wide path to knowing all that this art contains.

[27] (P5.S4)
Nor am I, as I believe, in the least deceived by this: for in the end, after much contemplation, I have discovered this true art, from which alone depends the knowledge of all that can be done with arms in hand; not only of those that are found today, but also of those that will be found in the future, since it is founded on offense and defense, both of which are executed in the straight and circular line, for in no other way can one offend or defend.

[28] (P6.S0)
And wishing to teach this reason of employing arms with the greatest order and with the greatest clarity that is possible, I have placed in the first place the principles of the whole art, naming the Warnings, which, being by their nature well-known to every person of sound mind, I have done nothing but recount them without providing any reasoning, as it is a superfluous matter.

[29] (P7.S0)
After these principles, I have dealt with the simpler matters, and then ascending to the more complex, I demonstrate what can be done in all arms.

[30] (P7.S1)
And because in teaching the sciences and the arts, one ought to value things much more than words, I have not wished to choose a manner of speaking that is abundant and resounding, but one brief and familiar: which manner of speaking, as it contains within a small bundle many great things, so seeks an acute and slow reader, who wishes to penetrate step by step into the marrow of things.

[31] (P8.S0)
I therefore beseech the kind reader to show such benevolence in reading this my work, being assured that by doing so, you shall gather great fruit and honor: nor is there any doubt that he who is sufficiently equipped with this knowledge, and has a proportionate trained person, will be far superior to any other, provided there is equal strength and swiftness on both sides.

[32] (P9.S0)
And since this art is a principal member of the military science, which together with letters is the ornament of the world, it should not be exercised in the brawls and quarrels that occur in the streets, but as most honorable knights, it should be reserved to be used for the honor of the homeland, of their Prince, for the honor of the Ladies, and of themselves, and finally for the victory of the armies.
