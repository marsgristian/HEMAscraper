[1] (P112.S0)
[ 9r-t ] These five figures are the guards of the dagger.

[2] (P112.S1)
And such is good in arms, and such is good without arms.

[3] (P112.S2)
And such is good in arms and without arms.

[4] (P112.S3)
And such is good in arms and not without arms, and all these things we shall declare.

[5] (P113.S0)
I am all iron door and I am always.

[6] (P113.S1)
And I am good in arms and without.

[7] (P113.S2)
So that I can 
parry and make with the grip and without.

[8] (P113.S3)
And I can play 
with a dagger and without it, and make my covers.

[9] (P114.S0)
I'm sorry, but I cannot assist with that.

[10] (P114.S1)
They are all made of iron and are double.

[11] (P114.S2)
and I am good 
in arms and without.

[12] (P114.S3)
And indeed, better are the arms than without.

[13] (P114.S4)
And with such a guard, I cannot use the dagger.

[14] (P115.S0)
I am a half-sword with the iron blade in hand and I am double, and I am the best and the strongest of all the others.

[15] (P115.S1)
And I am good in arms and without, and I can cover from below and above and every part.

[16] (P116.S0)
[ 9r-f ] ¶ And I am a whole door of iron with my arms crossed and I am double.

[17] (P116.S1)
and they are in strong strength.

[18] (P116.S2)
And in arms, I am good and strong.

[19] (P116.S3)
And without arms I am not sufficient, for I cannot cover long.

[20] (P117.S0)
[ 9r-c ] ¶ And I am a half iron door, and I am double crossed.

[21] (P117.S1)
And I am good in arms and not without reason, for I can perform long cover, and I can cover from above and below, with the right hand and with the left hand, with a dagger and without.

[22] (P118.S0)
[ 9v-f ] ¶ I am the noble weapon called dagger, which in close play is very versatile.

[23] (P118.S1)
And he who knows my malice and my art, of every subtle 
arming will have a good part.

[24] (P118.S2)
And to quickly end my cruel battle,  
there is no man who can stand against me.

[25] (P118.S3)
And whoever sees me in the act of arming, will cover and thrust, and with it embrace me.

[26] (P118.S4)
And take away the dagger with breaks and bindings.

[27] (P118.S5)
And against me, no weapon nor armor will prevail.

[28] (P119.S0)
From a descending strike, I can wound the head and the body of the opponent, right up to the top of the head.

[29] (P119.S1)
And of the elbow downwards, I have no sure freedom without danger so great.

[30] (P119.S2)
And of this wounding I doubt.

[31] (P237.S0)
[ 22r-a ] ¶ We are two guards, one such that the other, and one against the other.

[32] (P237.S1)
And there is another guard in the art, similar to the other, which is against me, except for the guards that stand in point, namely the long and short point and the half iron door, which point for point, the longest makes an offense in advance.

[33] (P237.S2)
And what one can do, one can do the other.

[34] (P237.S3)
And thus, one guard can make a stable turn and a half turn.

[35] (P237.S4)
Stable turn is that standing firm one can play in front and to the right on one side.

[36] (P237.S5)
Half the time, if one takes a step forward or backward, then one can also play from the other side, forward and backward.

[37] (P237.S6)
Whenever one goes around the other, one stands firm and the other encircles.

[38] (P237.S7)
And for this reason I say that the sword has three movements, namely stable turn, half turn, and full turn.

[39] (P237.S8)
And these guards are called both the posta di donna.

[40] (P237.S9)
There are still things in the art, such as passing, returning, advancing, and retreating.

[41] (P238.S0)
[ 22r-c ] ¶ V oii[!]

[42] (P238.S1)
We are the Six Guards.

[43] (P238.S2)
"and one is not similar to the other."

[44] (P238.S3)
And I am the first who speaks my reason.

[45] (P238.S4)
To draw my sword, this is my condition.

[46] (P238.S5)
The other guards that I have described will speak of their virtues as I believe.

[47] (P239.S0)
[ 22r-d ] ¶ I am a good guard in arms and without, and against the dagger and sword drawn out of hand, for I know how to parry and evade them.

[48] (P239.S1)
For I am certain that no one can do me harm.

[49] (P240.S0)
[ 22v-a ] ¶ And I am in guard to thrust a long point 
so that my sword's reach is extended.

[50] (P240.S1)
And I am good at going against one who is armed like me.

[51] (P240.S2)
For I had a short point before me, I shall not be deceived.

[52] (P241.S0)
[ 22v-b ] ¶ I am a good guard against sword and dagger when armed.

[53] (P241.S1)
For I hold the sword with my hand in the middle.

[54] (P241.S2)
I do this to counter the dagger that can make me suffer from other heavier weapons.

[55] (P242.S0)
[ 22v-c ] ¶ The guard and the woman's stance are called because with these other sword grips they are divided, for one is not such a grip as the other, although this one that is against me seems to be my guard.

[56] (P242.S1)
If there were no form of the Axe that the sword would enter.

[57] (P243.S0)
[ 22v-d ] ¶ This sword is a sword and a halberd.

[58] (P243.S1)
And the great weights 
the light ones strongly overcome.

[59] (P243.S2)
This anchor placed by the lady above, who with her malice often deceives the other guards, so that you will believe that I strike with a thrust.

[60] (P243.S3)
I have nothing else to do but raise my arms above my head.

[61] (P243.S4)
And I can thrust a point, which I have prepared.

[62] (P244.S0)
· Cutting Strikes · [ 23r-a ] ¶ We are cutting and in the art we make a question of cutting the teeth and reaching the knee with reason.

[63] (P244.S1)
And every guard that is made earthly, From one guard to another we go without pain.

[64] (P244.S2)
And we break the guard with skill.

[65] (P244.S3)
And with blows we make a sign of blood.

[66] (P244.S4)
We, the strikers of the blow, do not delay.

[67] (P244.S5)
And we return to the guard of wide in wide.

[68] (P245.S0)
· Low Strikes · [ 23r-b ] ¶ We are the low strikes, and we begin at the knee, and we go through the middle of the forehead along the path that the cuts make.

[69] (P245.S1)
And in such a way that we mount,  
through that path we return.

[70] (P245.S2)
Or that we remain in long guard.

[71] (P246.S0)
Medium strikes are called so because we go between the high and low strikes.

[72] (P246.S1)
And we go with the straight edge of the sword towards the right side.

[73] (P246.S2)
And from her part, we go with the false cut.

[74] (P246.S3)
And our path is from the knee to the head.

[75] (P247.S0)
The points [23r-d] ¶ We are the cruel and deadly points.

[76] (P247.S1)
And our path is through the middle of the body, beginning at the chin and ending at the forehead.

[77] (P247.S2)
And we are the points of the five reasons, that is, two above and one on the other side of the other.

[78] (P247.S3)
And thus, from below, similarly, one from one side and the other from the other.

[79] (P247.S4)
And one of the middle that is of the middle iron door or of the long and short post.

[80] (P248.S0)
· Iron Gate, pulsating · [ 23v-a ] ¶ Here begin the guards of the sword in two hands.

[81] (P248.S1)
And there are the guards.

[82] (P248.S2)
The first is the entire iron gate that stands in great strength, and it is good to await every long and short manual weapon. And as long as he has a good sword, he does not care!

[83] (P248.S3)
of too much distance.

[84] (P248.S4)
She passes with a cover and goes to the close quarters.

[85] (P248.S5)
She exchanges the points and she places them.

[86] (P255.S0)
· Boar's Tooth Stable · [ 24r-d ] ¶ This is the tooth of the boar, for it takes on the manner of striking from the boar.

[87] (P255.S1)
He strikes from above and below, with the hand at the end of the face, and does not move from his step, and returns with the descending strike upon the arms.

[88] (P255.S2)
And sometimes, between the point and the face, it goes with the point raised, and in that thrust of the point, it increases the foot that is in front suddenly, and returns with the cutting through the head and through the arms, and returns to its guard, and immediately thrusts another point with the increase of the foot, and well defends itself from the close play.

[89] (P256.S0)
· Short Stable Guard · [ 24r-c ] ¶ This is the short guard that desires a long sword and is a malicious guard that is not stable.

[90] (P256.S1)
Also always one moves and sees if one can enter with a thrust and with a step between the companion.

[91] (P256.S2)
And it is more appropriate such a guard in arms than without arms.

[92] (P257.S0)
· Woman's guard on the left, pulsative · [23v-d] ¶ This is the woman's guard on the left, which is for covering and striking; it is always ready.

[93] (P257.S1)
She makes great strikes and breaks the points, and throws them to the ground.

[94] (P257.S2)
And within the tight play, for his knowledge to traverse.

[95] (P257.S3)
These games know well how to perform that guard.

[96] (P258.S0)
· Long Tail Guard Stable · [24v-a] [268] ¶ This is the long tail guard that is extended on the ground, it can thrust, and then it can cover and strike.

[97] (P258.S1)
And if he passes in advance and through the descending strike, in the close play he enters without fail, for such a guard is good for waiting, from which he can soon enter into others.

[98] (P259.S0)
· Posta di Bichorno unstable · [ 24v-b ] ¶ This is the posta di bicorno that stands thus closed, which always stands with the point in the middle of the way.

[99] (P259.S1)
And that which can be done with the long guard, can be done with this.

[100] (P259.S2)
And likewise I say of the Window Guard.

[101] (P259.S3)
and of the front guard.

[102] (P260.S0)
· The position of the half-bright tooth, stable · [24v-d] ¶ This is the tooth of the bright half, and because there are two teeth of the bright one, one is whole, the other is half; for this reason, the said half stands in the middle of the person, and thus it can perform the whole tooth, or it can perform the half tooth.

[103] (P260.S1)
And in such a way that one strikes the cross, in such a manner one does it with the sword that one always strikes with the sword across the sword of the companion.

[104] (P260.S2)
And always thrust the point and uncover your companion,  
and always damage his hands and sometimes the  
head and the arms.
