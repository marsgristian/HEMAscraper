[1] (P378.S0)
[ 41r-a ] ¶ I hold my lance in the position of the boar's tooth, for I am well armored, and yes, I wield a shorter lance than my companion, and thus I reason to deflect his lance off the path, either to the side or upward.

[2] (P378.S1)
And if I strike him with my lance in his, one arm in between with one arm of my spear, and my lance will run into his person.

[3] (P378.S2)
And his lance will go off the path far from me, and in such a manner I will do.

[4] (P379.S0)
[ 41r-c ] ¶ This is the counter to the play of the lance that is in front, which occurs when one charges against the other with blunted weapons, and one with a shorter lance than the other.

[5] (P379.S1)
Here, when one with a short spear holds his spear low in the teeth of the boar, he who has the long spear should likewise carry his low, so that the short spear cannot counter the long one in the manner that is depicted here.

[6] (P380.S0)
[ 41v-b ] ¶ This is another way to carry the lance against the lance.

[7] (P380.S1)
This master teaches the short spear and how to hold it in the left shoulder as you can see, to parry and strike the opponent.

[8] (P382.S0)
[ 42r-b ] ¶ This master who is not armed, and has a good running horse, always thrusts the points with his lance towards himself to wound the companion.

[9] (P382.S1)
And if he were to turn to the right side, he could well enter with his spear into the mouth of a boar, or in the guard of the lady on the left, and parry and finish as one can do in the first and in the third thrust of the spear.

[10] (P383.S0)
This sword guard against the lance is very fine for rebuffing the lance while riding on the right side of your companion.

[11] (P383.S1)
And this guard is good against all other manual weapons, such as against the axe, staff, sword, and others.

[12] (P384.S0)
[ 42v-a ] ¶ This is against the flow of the play that is before, that this master with the lance strikes low to wound the horse, or in the head, or in the chest, that the companion cannot counter with the sword so low.

[13] (P385.S0)
[ 42v-d ] ¶ This is another counter to the lance against the sword, that the one with the lance places and keeps his lance under his weary arm so that his lance is not knocked away.

[14] (P385.S1)
And in such a manner, one may strike with his lance as with his sword.

[15] (P386.S0)
[ 43r-a ] [No text]

[16] (P387.S0)
[ 43r-c ] ¶ This is the counter to the play of the lance and of the sword that is before, that is, when one with the lance strikes fiercely at the head of his opponent, so that the one with the sword cannot parry the lance with the sword so low.

[17] (P388.S0)
[ 43v-b ] ¶ This position of the sword is called posta de coda longa, and it is very good against the lance and against every manual weapon, riding it straight against your enemy.

[18] (P388.S1)
And keep in mind that the thrusts and the reverse strikes must be parried outward, that is, to the side and not upward.

[19] (P388.S2)
And the strikes of cuts should be parried in a similar manner, lifting a little the sword of your enemy, and then you can perform the plays according to the figures depicted.

[20] (P389.S0)
[ 43v-d ] ¶ Here is this proper guard of the long tail, which is good when one comes against you with the sword, with the hand reversed, as this my enemy comes.

[21] (P389.S1)
And know that this guard is against all strikes from the right side and from the left side, and against any thrust, whether straight or crooked.

[22] (P389.S2)
And here begins the plays of the long tail, which always counters in the manner that has been said before in the first guard of the long tail.

[23] (P391.S0)
[ 44r-a ] ¶ This is the first play of the guard of the long tail that is presented here, where the master counters the sword of his enemy and places the point in his chest, or aims for his face as depicted here.

[24] (P392.S0)
[ 44r-b ] ¶ This is the second play that is to counter that, I strike this one upon the head, for I see well that he is not armored on the head.

[25] (P393.S0)
[ 44r-c ] ¶ This is another play, the third, that counters the sword of his enemy; he takes it with the weary hand, and thus strikes him on the head.

[26] (P393.S1)
And thus he could wound him with the point.

[27] (P394.S0)
[ 44r-d ] ¶ This is the fourth play where the student wishes to strike at the head and take away the sword, in the manner that you see depicted here.

[28] (P395.S0)
[ 44v-b ] ¶ This is the Sixth that one must take the sword from the companion.

[29] (P395.S1)
With the one maintaining the sword, the other maintains the lever in the air, from the hand it will fall.

[30] (P395.S2)
sword for certain.

[31] (P396.S0)
[ 44v-a ] ¶ This is the fifth play that makes the cover with the parry of the sword.

[32] (P396.S1)
I throw my arm around his neck as I turn quickly, with the whole sword I thrust him to the ground without doubt.

[33] (P396.S2)
And my against the right side is the second play.

[34] (P396.S3)
Although being armed, to do it, is not long.

[35] (P397.S0)
[ 44v-c ] ¶ This is the Seventh play that is contrary to the fifth.

[36] (P397.S1)
The wound that he inflicts upon the leg of that one and himself.

[37] (P397.S2)
If your companion were armed, do not trust in it.

[38] (P398.S0)
[ 44v-d ] ¶ This is the eighth play that is against the river of all the plays that are before me.

[39] (P398.S1)
and I will tell you of the games of sword on horseback, and of their masters who are in the guard of the long tail.

[40] (P398.S2)
Here are the masters, or scholars, who stand in the aforementioned guard, and I shall show them to you.

[41] (P398.S3)
a thrust or another strike, and immediately they parry my cut or thrust that I make. When they parry me, I quickly turn my sword, and with my pommel, I strike them in the face.

[42] (P398.S4)
And then I step with my cover ready  
and with my round reverse I strike him on the head.

[43] (P399.S0)
[ 45r-a ] ¶ The ninth sound that I make against the opponent who challenges me.

[44] (P399.S1)
That here I do not turn my sword around,  
immediately I set my guard, as you will see me,  
for with the pommel in the turn, he cannot wound me.

[45] (P399.S2)
And if I raise the sword in the air, and from the reverse I take a turn, it could well be that the sword would be taken from you.

[46] (P399.S3)
And if he fails me that I do not do it, I will give you the reverse of the sword in the face.

[47] (P399.S4)
Either I will strike you on the head with the pommel, thus I shall make my turn swift.

[48] (P399.S5)
¶ Here ends the game on horseback 
from sword to sword.

[49] (P399.S6)
He who knows more gives a good blow.

[50] (P400.S0)
[ 45r-b ] ¶ This is the game of Abrazare, or the game of the arms, and it is done in this manner.

[51] (P400.S1)
When one thrusts at you and you are tired of parrying, you come close to him. With your right hand, you take him by the edges of the gorget, and if he is unarmed, you can grab him by the ankles, or by the right arm to throw him over his shoulders, in such a way that you will make him fall to the ground.

[52] (P401.S0)
[ 45r-c ] ¶ This is the counter to the play that is before; it is of such value, this counter is made with such a grip that it is done suddenly when he takes it from above. The hand of the bridle should immediately change, and with the arm, one should take it in such a way.

[53] (P402.S0)
[ 45r-d ] ¶ This student wishes to throw this one from horseback, as he takes him by the stirrup and lifts him up straight.

[54] (P402.S1)
If it does not go to the ground, it will surely remain in the air, unless it is not tied to the horse; this play cannot be failed.

[55] (P402.S2)
And if he does not, he takes the foot in the stirrup for the neck of the foot, which is more valuable, lifting it in the manner as previously stated.

[56] (P402.S3)
Do what is written before you here.

[57] (P403.S0)
[ 45v-a ] ¶ The contrary of the play described here is that if someone takes you by the stirrup, or by the foot, throw your arm around their neck, and do this immediately.

[58] (P403.S1)
And in such a manner, I shall unhorse you from your horse.

[59] (P403.S2)
If you do this, it will go to the ground without fail.

[60] (P404.S0)
[ 45v-b ] ¶ This is an Act of throwing one to the ground with the horse.

[61] (P404.S1)
The remedy for throwing one to the ground, all the horse, is done in this manner.

[62] (P404.S2)
When you encounter one on horseback.

[63] (P404.S3)
Ride her straight from your part.

[64] (P404.S4)
And your right arm, thrust it above the neck of his horse, and take his bridle near the mouth that is in the bit, and turn it upwards by force.

[65] (P404.S5)
And the chest of your horse makes it go 
through the middle of the back of his horse.

[66] (P404.S6)
And in such a manner it is fitting to walk on the ground with the whole horse.

[67] (P405.S0)
[ 45v-d ] ¶ This is a game of pulling the reins of the horse from the hand of the companion, in such a way that you see here it depends.

[68] (P405.S1)
The student, when he encounters another on horseback, rides to the right side, and throws his right arm over the neck of the horse, and takes the reins with his left hand, with his hand turned downwards.

[69] (P405.S2)
And between the bridle of the head of the horse.

[70] (P405.S3)
And this play is more secure when armed than unarmed.

[71] (P406.S0)
[ 46v-a ] ¶ This master has tied a strong rope to the saddle of his horse and one end, the other end should be tied to the head of his lance.

[72] (P406.S1)
First, he wants to strike him, and then the spear, thus bound to the weary side of his enemy, he will throw over the shoulder, in order to be able to drag him down from the horse.

[73] (P407.S0)
[ 46v-c ] ¶ This Ribaldo was fleeing to a fortress.

[74] (P407.S1)
So I ran that I reached the fortress, always charging at full speed.

[75] (P407.S2)
And with my sword I struck him 
under the armpit, 
There where a man can be harmed badly.

[76] (P407.S3)
And for fear of my own friends, I wish to return.

[77] (P408.S0)
[ 46v-d ] ¶ Here ends the book that the scholar Fiore has made, who knows in this art, here he has set it down, namely in all the armizare, in this book is the flower called Fior di Battaglia.

[78] (P408.S1)
That for whom it is made may always be appreciated, for nobility and virtue are not found in equality. Fior Furlan, I commend myself to you, poor old man.
