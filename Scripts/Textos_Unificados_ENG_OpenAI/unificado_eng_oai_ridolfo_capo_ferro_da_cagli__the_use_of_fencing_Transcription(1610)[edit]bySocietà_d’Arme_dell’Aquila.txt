[1] (P122.S0)
[ 25 ] NOW FOLLOWS THE GREAT SIMULACRUM OF THE USE OF FENCING.

[2] (P123.S0)
And first it is declared the difference that is found between the Art and the use.

[3] (P123.S1)
There is a great difference between the Art and its use, and perhaps not lesser than that between reason and chance, between the confused and the well-ordered, between knowledge and opinion.

[4] (P123.S2)
In order for this matter to be more clearly understood, it is necessary that we briefly consider and declare the definition of the art, which, as I recall having heard discussed by some learned individuals, is nothing other than a multitude of useful precepts well arranged for civil preservation; for a single flower does not make Spring, nor is one single precept sufficient to constitute the art. Moreover, regardless of the number of precepts within the art, those are ultimately approved which are useful and not harmful, and not those that are submerged in the abyss of the dark shadows of false and deceptive opinions.

[5] (P123.S3)
For the art does not govern itself according to its own will, but directs all its precepts according to the rule given to it by the law of truth.

[6] (P123.S4)
The truth commands the art that does not rest in the air and that teaches only those things which are of infallible and perpetual truth.

[7] (P123.S5)
And those precepts that do not stand in comparison to their laws, he does not recognize as his own.

[8] (P123.S6)
The use of the art expands much further and considers not only the true things, but also warns us of the false and many other particulars that occur in various ways, and to demonstrate its effects, it takes advantage of the assistance of many disciplines.

[9] (P123.S7)
For just as we see daily occurring in civil society that a man is not sufficient to carry out the office or the art he practices unless he is aided by those with whom he civilly resides, so all the arts, all the sciences, and all the professions are interconnected and linked together in such a way that one requires the mutual assistance of the other when seeking to put its teachings into execution; nonetheless, just as in civil usage each man has his own office, his separate house, and his distinct possessions, so the arts and sciences have their own distinct boundaries and their proper precepts, which it is not permissible to transgress.

[10] (P123.S8)
This difference between the art and the use, because it is not observed by some who teach, leads them to fall into many very serious errors.

[11] (P123.S9)
Then it happens that in teaching both with the pen and with the sword in hand, they are so prolix and so confused, and most of the time contradictory to themselves: and because they do not first lay down the solid foundation of the infallible and well-ordered precepts of the art, with much greater ease and in a very short time they would lead their students to that degree of perfection which can be desired in this science.

[12] (P123.S10)
In consideration of this, to facilitate the art of fencing, I have endeavored to clear away all difficulties and to extract it from the dark shadows of confusion, condensing it into very few teachings separated from its usage: and now I present to you and lay before your eyes a very few figures, most of which declare our art, leaving to others the task of employing their study in the uncertainty and infinity of particular matters, which we see daily occurring in the use of arms without remaining in the same state; and if these instabilities and varieties of things are indeed to be taught much better, in my opinion, in the school, they are remembered gradually rather than learned through knowledge.

[13] (P123.S11)
But it is now time, let us come to the declaration of some reminders and warnings, as well as of certain terms of fencing that pertain to the practice, and of our figures as well.

[14] (P124.S0)
[27] SOME REMEMBRANCES OR WARNINGS OF FENCING 1 First, if one finds oneself in hand-to-hand with an opponent, one must always keep an eye on the hand of the sword, more than on any other place, for all other areas are deceptive; because by watching the hand, one sees the stillness and all the movements it makes, and from these (according to one's judgment) one can determine what one must do.

[15] (P125.S0)
OF PARING AND STRIKING AND AVOIDING OF LIFE.

[16] (P125.S1)
The good player, when he plays, must never parry unless he responds with a strike, nor should he attempt to strike unless he is sure to parry the response, nor should he evade life unless he strikes; and if he must parry with the dagger, when the dagger moves to parry, the sword must move to strike.

[17] (P126.S0)
THE VIRTUE OF THE SWORD ALONE.

[18] (P126.S1)
You should know that the sword alone is the queen and foundation of all other weapons, so that the delight in it is as much and more beneficial than the others, because one learns to parry, strike, and evade with greater certainty, to draw the sword, to counter-draw, to gain the sword from the opponent in all guards; and in the aforementioned actions, you should take care to keep your arm well extended, for you will push away all the opponent's strikes far from your life.

[19] (P127.S0)
HOW ONE MUST HOLD AGAINST A BEASTLY MAN.

[20] (P127.S1)
If you encounter a beastly man who, without measure and time, strikes you with great force many blows, you can do two things: first, by employing the play of the half-time, as I teach you in its place, you will wound him, in his striking, with a thrust or a cut to the hand or the arm of the sword, or indeed, you may let him go by evading somewhat with your body backward and then immediately thrusting a point into his face, or indeed into his chest.

[21] (P128.S0)
WAY TO BECOME A PERFECT PLAYER.

[22] (P128.S1)
5 U ONE who wishes to become a perfect player must not only take lessons from the Master, but must also seek daily to play with various players, and whenever possible, he should always practice with those who know more than he does, for the player with many practiced minds will attain this virtue most perfectly.

[23] (P129.S0)
OF THE SAFEST GUARD.

[24] (P129.S1)
6 T V you know that in my book of the art I do not present anything but one guard, which is the low guard called third with the sword held flat in a straight line, which must divide the right side in the middle and the point of it must always regard the middle of the opponent's waist, that is, the closest parts; and it is safer than the other high guards, because the aforementioned high guards can easily be struck by thrust or cut to the leg, and in the low guards, as I say, there is no such danger: the virtue of it is only to thrust and to strike naturally.

[25] (P130.S0)
OF THE VANITIES OF THE FENCES.

[26] (P130.S1)
7 The feints are not good because they waste time and measure; the other is that the feint will be made either within measure or out of measure: if it is made out of measure, it does not happen that I move, but if it is made within measure, while he feigns, I shall strike.

[27] (P131.S0)
FROM WHOM ONE OUGHT TO LEARN.

[28] (P131.S1)
You must know that there are some who, as soon as they have learned a little and having still a bit of practice, set out to teach others and teach without foundation or true rule, not knowing that knowledge is quite different from teaching, and this way of teaching is acquired over a long time. For just as the measure and the time to know it require great time, so he who does not know measure, nor time, and does not have a way to teach, may be called an imperfect player, and one should be wary of learning from such.

[29] (P132.S0)
OF GAINING THE SWORD 9 N It is of no small profit nor of little beauty to know how to gain the sword from the adversary in all guards; and it is also of no small importance, should the adversary have gained yours, to know how to recover it. Thus, in this occasion, should it be gained from you, you can do three things: first, you must never draw for a finished strike, nor draw for a parry and then wound; the second, by retreating while yielding a little with the body and lowering the sword, and if the adversary wishes to follow you, you can at the same time, as he comes forward to approach and regain it, wound him in the movement of the right foot, either below or above his sword, as it may be more convenient for you; and furthermore, it must be noted that we intend to grip the sword as much as we intend to gain it.

[30] (P133.S0)
OF STRIKING IN COUNTERTIME.

[31] (P133.S1)
In many ways, one can strike in counter-time, but I approve of only two. This will be when you find yourself with your sword in the fourth position, with the point of it facing towards your right side, and as your opponent approaches to gain it, you, at the very moment he moves his right foot to place his sword against yours, will thrust with the point from the aforementioned fourth, stepping forward with your left foot, or indeed with your right; or finding yourself in the third position and he comes to gain it from the outside, you will thrust with the second by passing as described above.

[32] (P134.S0)
OF THE WALKING.

[33] (P134.S1)
11 M Many and varied are the opinions of Masters regarding this action of walking with arms in hand; I say (according to my judgment) that when walking both from the right side and from the left of the opponent, one must always be mindful to move the left foot accompanied by the right, and when walking in a straight line, one foot must push the other, both forward as well as backward; but the true walking will be done naturally, ensuring that the point of the right shoulder is always forward and bringing the left foot across so that its point faces towards the left side.

[34] (P135.S0)
METHOD OF STRIKING TO THE HAND.

[35] (P135.S1)
12 D E you must know that whenever your opponent has the point of his sword out of your presence, whether high or low, or if he is looking out to your left or right sides, you shall meet him with the point of your sword in a straight line, bending somewhat your waist back, you will approach to measure, and when you have arrived, you will thrust a point of half-time into the said hand: by merely pushing your waist forward, bending your right knee, he will be wounded; but you must take care that in such a thrust you should bring your left foot back accompanied by the right, and furthermore, if the enemy has the dagger arm advanced, wishing to wound him in the hand, you shall maintain the same order as above.

[36] (P136.S0)
WAY TO RETREAT, IF YOU SHOULD BE WOUNDED.

[37] (P136.S1)
13 H Having struck your opponent with an extraordinary step using your right foot forward, whether in sword alone or in sword and dagger or indeed sword and cloak, you will retreat with an ordinary step, according to the position you will have behind: for if you have little space, you will only draw back your right leg, following with your sword the enemy's sword; but if you have space, you will take two ordinary steps back, the last of which will bring you into guard; and this is the true retreat, although in the schools they may teach otherwise.

[38] (P137.S0)
[ 32 ] DECLARATION OF SOME TERMS OF FENCING THAT PERTAIN TO ITS USE.

[39] (P137.S1)
For it is necessary for the students to know the terms used by the Masters of fencing in their teaching, we have proposed to declare them in the following very brief words.

[40] (P138.S0)
OF THE SWORD.

[41] (P138.S1)
In the sword, one considers the strong, the weak, the false edge, and the true edge; some prefer to divide the sword into three equal parts, namely the weak and the strong, which are its extreme parts, and that in the middle, since it partakes of both and is suited for both parrying and striking; there are also those who divide it into four parts, yet without any evident utility; these terms are simple and self-explanatory.

[42] (P139.S0)
OF THE GUARDS 2 G The guard is called a certain position of the sword's hilt, which whenever it is placed upon the shoulder forms the first; when it descends to align with the shoulder, it creates the second; when it lowers more outside the knee on your right side, it forms the third; the fourth is made when the hilt is positioned within the thigh; and these four guards are called principal, and thus far all are in agreement; as for the stance, the arm, the waist, the legs, and the line of the sword, opinions differ, for some praise the narrow stance and some the wide, certain the moderate, some extend the arm, while others draw it in more or less, some bend the waist, others straighten it, some form the guard by placing the right leg forward, now the left, some hold the sword in a straight line, some high and some low, now from one side, now from the other, now forward, now backward, in so many lines that are found in the world; others, according to different occasions, indiscriminately make use of all the aforementioned manners of guards, which, due to their differences, are called high, low, narrow, and wide, and acquire other names according to the whims of the Masters.

[43] (P139.S1)
Counterguards are named the third and the fourth, the one for pressing from the outside and this one for pressing from the inside, although all are counterguards, chosen according to the diversity of the lines of the sword.

[44] (P140.S0)
OF TIME.

[45] (P140.S1)
Four sorts of times are mentioned in the schools: the first, the two times, the half time, and the counter time. The first time is said to be when, finding myself at measure, either close or wide, I can strike the opponent with a single movement of the sword. Thus, it is understood that striking in two times requires at least two movements of the sword. The half time is when, at a wide measure, I strike the opponent on the exposed and advanced arm, whether it be that of the dagger or that of the sword, either with the point or with the edge; or when I strike the opponent at a close measure, moving as he attempts to strike me or to perform some other action. The doubling of strikes is done more than in half time, in counter time: it is when at the same time the opponent wishes to strike me, I meet him in a shorter time and measure. And it should be understood that all movements and all rests of the opponent are times, thus at measure.

[46] (P141.S0)
OF THE MEASURE.

[47] (P141.S1)
The measure is wide or narrow: wide when one can strike the opponent only in the extraordinary step, narrow when I can strike the opponent in the proper step, at a firm foot.

[48] (P142.S0)
IN HOW MANY TIMES ONE RECOGNIZES THE STRIKE.

[49] (P142.S1)
5 The first is when the enemy is steady in guard and he raises or moves the foot that he has forward to approach; that is the time. The second is when you have parried the blow; then it is time. The third is when he moves without judgment from one guard to another, before he is steady in it; that is the time to strike him. Moreover, it is time when he raises the sword while he raises the hand; that is the time to wound him. And the last is when the blow has passed outside of the person; that is the time to follow him with the counter.

[50] (P143.S0)
OF THE STEP AND OF WALKING.

[51] (P143.S1)
6 The step is called ordinary, extraordinary, right, half step, narrow, and wide, and it increases and decreases according to the diversity of these steps; one walks now forward and now backward, now to the side, now across with one leg or with both; there are also those who, withdrawing the leg forward to evade the strike, keep it suspended in the air to respond with greater swiftness.

[52] (P144.S0)
OF THE PARRIES.

[53] (P144.S1)
7 I say that for both the straight edge and the false edge, though rarely, both in a straight line and in an oblique line, now with the point high, now low, now upwards, now downwards, according to whether one strikes with the point or with the edge, and with either of the weapons or with both, noting that all parries require an extended arm and must be accompanied by the right leg followed by the left; and when it is necessary to parry with two times, at the moment of parrying, the left foot shall be drawn up close to the right, and then in striking, the right shall be advanced forward.

[54] (P145.S0)
OF THE FEINTS AND OF THE COVERING OF THE SWORD.

[55] (P145.S1)
8 F The feints are those deceptive gestures of the sword that are made both with the edge and with the point, outside and inside the sword, up and down, forward and backward, and in a circle, also in straight and oblique lines, towards one weapon and the other; and these feints strike directly opposite to what they indicate; the counter-feints are made in the opposite manner to the feints.

[56] (P145.S2)
The covering of the sword is a kind of feint and is done by covering the tip of the opponent's sword with the weak part of your own sword, at the moment when it is in low fourth and should be executed in a straight line.

[57] (P146.S0)
[ 36 ] OF THE CHANGE FROM GUARD TO GUARD.

[58] (P146.S1)
9 The change of guard to guard can be done in three ways: directly, inversely, and by exchange; directly when I first move from the first to the second and from the second to the third or from the third to the fourth; inversely when I go from the fourth to the third, from the third to the second, and from the second to the first; by exchange when I move from the first to the fourth or from the fourth to the first and from the first to the third or from the third to the first or from the second to the fourth or from the fourth to the second.

[59] (P146.S2)
However, I advise you that when changing from one guard to another, being at measure, you should move your left leg back accompanied by the right, thus you will be secure from the opponent.

[60] (P147.S0)
AGAINST THOSE WHO TURN.

[61] (P147.S1)
10 P Because it could easily happen that the opponent, while turning, gains your sword from the inside, in such an event you will immediately draw your sword from the outside, bringing your left leg accompanied by the right across towards the right side of your opponent, placing the tip of your sword in a straight line that points towards the enemy's right shoulder. And as he comes from the outside to regain it, in such an approach you will thrust from below his sword and wound him with a thrust from the fourth, advancing your right leg forward in an extraordinary step.

[62] (P148.S0)
[ 37 ] AGAINST THE LEFT FOOT GUARD.

[63] (P148.S1)
11 R When the opponent finds himself in low third with his left leg forward, you will place yourself against him similarly in third, but with your right leg forward and the point of your sword crossed towards your left side; and this for two reasons: the first of which is that he cannot dominate your sword, which he seeks to do with his dagger, the second is that by exposing your waist more, you invite him to advance, and as he advances, you will parry with your sword in the same third, with the point raised, and as he passes, you will stab him in the chest.

[64] (P148.S2)
Furthermore, if you wish to be the first to strike against the aforementioned guard of the lower left, you will meet it similarly in third with your sword in a straight line, ensuring that the point faces the hand of the enemy's dagger, so that you may comfortably deliver a thrust of half-time to that hand; or you may make a feint above the dagger, and if he wishes to parry, you will draw your sword beneath his dagger, stepping forward with your left foot and finding with your dagger at the same time the enemy's sword, you will strike him with the point beneath the arm; moreover, one can also feign beneath the dagger, and if he wishes to parry again, you will draw and strike him with a second thrust above his dagger, stepping and parrying as described above, noting that one can also feign and strike without stepping, but merely by waiting for the opponent, feigning that you will pass to strike, and then you, by simply yielding your body back in his advance and parrying with your dagger the enemy's sword, will strike him above or below his dagger, according to the opportunity that presents itself to you.

[65] (P148.S3)
Moreover, it must be noted that when dealing with a left-handed person, and he stands with his right foot forward, you should meet him with your left foot, with your sword held low and withdrawn, and with your body leaning towards your right side. To the same side, you will direct your weapons, so that by doing this, you will put the opponent's mind at a disadvantage, as he will be unable to strike any blow that does not land on your defenses.

[66] (P149.S0)
OF THE GRIP OF THE SWORD.

[67] (P149.S1)
The sword is tightened in order to come to measure or to uncover the opponent, from outside and inside, high and low, but always in a straight line, while the opponent stops or moves, and most often it is done in two times: first, you acquire the weak of the sword with a palm of the weak of your own, in the second time you acquire the beginning of the strong of the opponent's sword, as he draws, counter-drawing you or not; but you must ensure that it is done in a straight line and that the strong accompanies the weak along with the motion of the leg.

[68] (P150.S0)
A MOST USEFUL REMEMBRANCE REGARDING THE MASTERING OF THE SWORD.

[69] (P150.S1)
The sword is mastered in two ways: in the first, when having gained the opponent's sword, I never depart from the mastery in striking.

[70] (P150.S2)
In the second, having struck the sword in whichever manner so that it goes beyond my presence, at that time when it moves forcefully, it is understood to be within my domain, in which I must strike before it can redeem itself.

[71] (P150.S3)
The mastery of the sword alone is of stillness or of motion, one of the point and the other of the edge.

[72] (P150.S4)
One dominates with the strong in the parry or strikes with the weak to seek the time and the measure.

[73] (P150.S5)
In the art of the sword alone, having dominated the enemy's sword with the strong, one should never respond with a cut, but rather with a thrust; both could be executed having dominated the enemy's sword with your sword and dagger together, which remains in the guard of the dominion, although I urge you to always strike with the point because it is more deadly, and never should the sword be lifted from the presence: the contrary is true for the cut.

[74] (P151.S0)
OF THE STRIKING AND COUNTER-STRIKING.

[75] (P151.S1)
14 The cavare, as well as the contracavare, is done to evade the time, the measure, or indeed to gain it, and they are executed either forward or backward, according to the intended purpose; the manner of contracavare is to follow the opponent's sword, returning your sword to the previous position, and this can be done from either side.

[76] (P151.S2)
One must also know that the drawing of the sword can be executed from above as well as from below against the enemy's sword to gain it, but the difference between the two in the drawing is this: that when drawing from below to bind, it should be done with the arm extended and with a slight rise of the foot; and the drawing from above must be done by bending at the waist, with the arm and sword in an oblique line backward, so that your sword has freed the point of the enemy's sword, quickly placing the forte of your sword above theirs. This method of drawing can be used both to strike and to bind.

[77] (P152.S0)
OF STRIKING.

[78] (P152.S1)
15 There are two kinds of striking: cutting and thrusting; but each of these has within it more natures, according to its manner of striking, for the straight strike will be either ordinary or descending or round or ascending or overwhelming or doubling, and from the reverse sides they will be as above; the thrusts are divided into four natures; the straight strike is that which begins from the straight sides and is called ordinary, which is that which passes in an oblique line, that is, from the left shoulder to the right knee of the enemy.

[79] (P152.S2)
But the descending strike is called that which goes to wound in a straight line, from above down; the round strike is referred to that which turns across.

[80] (P152.S3)
And the rising is that which starts with the straight edge of the sword from below and goes to strike at the tip of the opponent's right shoulder.

[81] (P152.S4)
Stramazzone is that which is done with the knot of the hand in the manner of a Wheel; they call it a redouble when, having struck down the enemy's sword with a half mandritto, you go turning another ordinary mandritto. The false strike is then determined in two ways, namely straight and reverse: you can use the false straight to strike outward against the enemy's sword, that is, towards their right side, and with the false reverse, you will strike towards their left side; however, in my opinion, if you need to parry a false straight, I say it will be much better to turn the knot of the hand well and parry with the true edge, for greater safety, and it will turn the straight more quickly. But when you strike the blow with the false reverse, you can wound both with the point and with the edge, bearing in mind that when you parry with the false, you parry from the middle up of the sword towards the point, and when you parry with the true edge, you must parry with the strong from the middle of the sword down towards the hilt. Remember that the mandritti and the riversi are made with the motion of the elbow and sometimes, when the measure and the time allow, with the upper parts of the arm.

[82] (P153.S0)
OF THE CUT.

[83] (P153.S1)
16 The Cuts should be made to saw, both because in this manner it strikes all the weak points, and also because little by little it will come to cut with the more grazing part of the edge; and for these reasons the descending cuts are stronger than those that stop from the waist up, in that the aforementioned upper and lower parts are found, more or less, to be in measure, suitable to be struck to saw.

[84] (P154.S0)
[ 41 ] OF THE POINT.

[85] (P154.S1)
In the thrust, one recalls the thrust, the imbroccata, and the reverse thrust: the imbroccata starts from the first guard and aims to strike from the opponent's left shoulder down to their right knee with the false edge from below, so that the hand does not turn until it reaches the point of striking, and it must be delivered with force.

[86] (P154.S2)
The thrust is said to begin from the third guard and aims to strike the opponent towards the right shoulder; the reverse point starts from the fourth and strikes from outside the enemy's shoulder, turning the hand well inward; some add the false point that comes from below upwards, towards the opponent's chest, finding the sword in the low guard.

[87] (P155.S0)
[ 42 ] WAY TO TAKE HOLD OF THE SWORD.

[88] (P155.S1)
For in all countries the customs are not the same, and often enmities are exercised with little sincerity; to be prepared for all accidents, it may not be out of place to teach the way to take hold of the sword before we come to discuss its handling.

[89] (P155.S2)
However, if by chance you find yourself with your right leg forward when drawing your sword as shown in one of these figures, you should pull back that leg, extending at the same time your right arm high; and if by chance you find yourself with your left leg forward, as the other figure shows, it is only necessary to draw the sword in the aforementioned manner, without changing your step; and if you wish to make use of sword and cloak, or of sword and dagger, or even of sword alone, the true method is first to step forward with your right foot to present yourself in fourth, or if the opponent is close, you will draw your left foot back presenting yourself as above, and then with your convenience you will be able to wield the cloak or draw your hand to the dagger with greater security, since the point of your sword will keep the opponent at bay while you arrange your weapons, and this is all I need to say regarding this particular.

[90] (P156.S0)

[ 50 ] METHOD OF GAINING THE SWORD FROM WITHIN IN A STRAIGHT LINE AND STRIKING ACCORDING TO THE POINT THAT THE ENEMY'S SWORD WILL GIVE.

[110] (P158.S1)
There are two causes (it seems to me) for which it is necessary to bind the opponent, first to bind the sword in order to seek measure and time, and the other to bind the opponent's body to seek only the measure; these bindings are well considered in the straight line. And because there are two causes for bindings, there must also be two occasions: the first occasion for binding the sword to seek measure and time is when the said opponent finds himself in an oblique line, for when the opponent is with the sword in fourth, which regards your left side in an oblique line, finding yourself with the sword outside, stepping forward to bind it inside with the said straight line, as the figures demonstrate, nor should this bring you any difficulty, since it suffices for the said straight line to bind the sword to find the opponent's sword in an oblique line; the second occasion for binding the body to seek only the measure is when the opponent is in a straight line, or with the body exposed, then without binding the sword to seek the time, it is enough to bind the body with the straight line to find the measure and then strike according to the point, although the use of the art requires that one bind the sword in all lines without any utility.

[111] (P158.S2)
To wound according to the point must be understood whenever the tip of the opposing sword is in your presence: at that moment, you can strike in a straight line where the height of the tip of the enemy's sword will give its direction, taking however with the strong part of your sword a span of the tip of the enemy's sword, and you will surely wound, noting if it is high at the same level as your head, you will wound him in the face; and if it were at the same level as your waist, you could wound him in the face and in the chest: this is called wounding according to the point that the enemy's sword will give; moreover, in this way you can safely draw your sword in all directions to strike, when provocatively you bring the strong part of your sword first to the tip of the adversary's sword; and do not do as some masters do who draw or make draw to wound in the first intention, arriving with the tip of their sword at the strong part of the enemy's sword, not realizing that they give the point to the enemy and most of the time remain injured, as can be seen in our figures.

[112] (P159.S0)
[52] THE PRESENT AND FOLLOWING FIGURES SHOW DIFFERENT WAYS TO STRIKE FROM THE OUTSIDE, ALWAYS presupposing the closing in and the thrusting of your Opponent's point to wound.

[113] (P159.S1)
FOR the declaration of the following figures, I say that having D. closed in the figure marked C., the same figure C. withdrawing to thrust a point into the chest of figure D., D. strikes him with a point in the left eye, either from a firm stance or by advancing as shown in the figure.

[114] (P159.S2)
But I also say that if C. had been a cautious person, when he drew, he would have drawn as if in jest, with his body somewhat restrained, and as D. came forward surely to strike C., he would have parried either with a false or true edge on the outside of the enemy's sword, delivering a thrust to the face or a cut to the chest, and in such a manner he would have retreated into the low fourth.

[115] (P160.S0)
[54] FIGURES THAT SHOW HOW MUCH IS LOST IN MEASURE WHEN STRIKING AT THE LEGS.

[116] (P160.S1)
[31] And having gained the sword from figure C. to figure D., the same figure C., turning a reverse through the leg towards the noted figure D., can strike D. while executing the reverse of a thrust to the arm or indeed a point to the face due to the excessive forward lean, as shown in the figure, yet with figure D. withdrawing the right leg back while striking.

[117] (P160.S2)
However, I say that if D. in tightening the sword against C. C. had been a cautious person, he would have unraveled it with a reverse strike to the face, accompanying it with a straight downward cut to the head, and thus he would have been more secure.

[118] (P161.S0)
[56] FIGURE THAT STRIKES IN PASSING WHILE THE OPPONENT DRAWS TO STRIKE.

[119] (P161.S1)
Having the figure marked D. gained the sword within the marked figure C., the same figure C. thrusting to deliver a stab to the face of figure D., D. wounds her with a second strike to the face, grasping with the left hand the hilt of the enemy's sword.

[120] (P161.S2)
However, I shall not fail to say that if C. had been a prudent person, he would have drawn his sword in a feigned manner, with his waist somewhat held back, and as D. confidently approached to pass, C., by feigning the enemy's sword from below and shifting with the avoidance of his waist, would strike him in the chest by passing with his rear leg crossed.

[121] (P162.S0)
[58] FIGURE THAT STRIKES FROM THE FOURTH IN THE POCKET, UNDER THE RIGHT ARM While The Opponent Draws To Strike.

[122] (P162.S1)
And having gained the sword from figure C. to figure D., the same figure C., turning a reverse towards figure D., strikes D. in the turn of the reverse, in the fourth, raising the arm well and the finish of the sword, increasing the step well, in the chest under the arm of the sword, as you see.

[123] (P162.S2)
However, I say that if C. instead of turning the reverse had drawn the sword back while retreating somewhat, and raised the sword in an oblique line, so that its point faced towards the left side of the Adversary, and D. wishing to enter in fourth, C. by parrying with a half downward strike would give him a reverse to the face, or indeed a thrust to the chest.

[124] (P163.S0)
[ 60 ] WAY OF STRIKING IN VARIOUS ACTIONS UNDER THE ENEMY.

[125] (P163.S1)
SWORD P For the rhyme of the third, you will place yourself in the high fourth crossed position, so that the tip of your sword responds to the left shoulder of the adversary, and as he comes to cover yours in an oblique line, you, in his approach, turning your hand into the second while bending and lowering your body, will strike him in counter-time to the life beneath his sword, as the figure shows.

[126] (P163.S2)
In the second case that the adversary has closed in on you, by feigning a thrust from the fourth towards the face, and he wishes to parry, by turning your hand with the same bend you will strike him beneath the sword, as described above.

[127] (P163.S3)
Third, if you had been pressed from within, you could execute a false thrust of the third to the face, and by raising your sword to parry, you would wound him beneath the sword, turning your hand into the second position, in the manner described above.

[128] (P163.S4)
Fourth, if your opponent is close to you and he attempts to stab you in the face, you can strike him in two ways: first, you can hit him in counter-time as he comes in, lowering your body and sword into the third guard; and you can also strike him by parrying in the third guard with the point high, turning your hand into the second position as you strike, in the manner described above.

[129] (P163.S5)
Fifth and last, if your opponent had been tight against you and he, seeking to bind your sword from the inside, at the same time turns his hand while lowering and bending his waist, you shall strike him with a third under the sword, in the same manner as above.

[130] (P164.S0)
[ 61a ] FIGURE THAT WITH THE SWORD WITH BOTH HANDS AND STRIKES WITH A CUT TO THE POINT IN THE THROAT WHILE THE Opponent draws the sword.

[131] (P164.S1)
Having the figure D. gained from within in low guard the sword at the marked figure C., and drawing said figure C. to deliver a thrust to the chest of figure D., D., passing with the left leg and at the same time pressing with both hands on the enemy's sword, wounds him in the chest with a third; but there is no doubt that if C. had been an intelligent person, when he drew the point to strike, he would have drawn it somewhat withheld, and while parrying and passing D. with both hands to strike C., C. merely by lowering the point of the sword towards the ground and turning the hand into second, by slightly shifting the waist towards the left side of the adversary and cutting with the edge over the enemy's sword, would wound him from inside with a reverse to the face, withdrawing into third, or, having parried, would pass with the left leg inside the right, turning the waist and taking his sword with both hands, in turning would give him a thrust to the chest by advancing upon him, for D. would not be able to help himself.

[132] (P165.S0)
[ 61c ] FIGURE THAT STRIKES WITH A CUTTING BLOW TO THE RIGHT SIDE IN PASSING WHILE THE OPPONENT STRIKES TO HIT.

[133] (P165.S1)
This method of striking is called the "scannatura," which is executed in the following manner: having secured the figure marked C from the outside, the sword is brought to the figure noted D. From this same figure D, one thrusts a point towards the face of figure C, while figure C faces the enemy's sword from the outside, lowering the point in second and passing with the left leg, at the same time striking in the side, lowering the waist to take hold of the hand, as you see.

[134] (P166.S0)
[62] FIGURE THAT STRIKES UNDER THE ENEMY'S SWORD IN COUNTERTIME WITHOUT PARING, only by lowering the waist as the figure shows.

[135] (P166.S1)
Having the figure marked D. gained the sword from within the figure C. & the same figure C. drawing back to deliver a thrust to the face of figure D., D., lowering the waist and raising the right leg at the same time, strikes him without parrying in counter-time from below the enemy's sword, as the figure shows.

[136] (P166.S2)
And furthermore, it could happen that the aforementioned thrust could be made otherwise, that is, that C. would strike to deliver a thrust to the face of figure D., D. would parry in the third with the point high, and at the same time lowering the point and turning the sword into the second, he could wound him in passing in the chest, while also taking hold of the hand of the sword.

[137] (P166.S3)
But if C. were a practical person, he could, by merely withdrawing his right foot back and at the same time facing the enemy's sword from the outside, lower the point and turn his hand in second, wound him with a cut beneath the enemy's sword, or in his retreat, he could parry with his left hand from above downwards under his arm and strike D. with a high second in the chest, or even in the face.

[138] (P167.S0)
[ 64 ] DOUBLE WAY TO GAIN THE SWORD OF THE OPPONENT, FROM WITHIN AND FROM WITHOUT.

[139] (P167.S1)
Recognizing how useful it is, through experience, to know how to seize the enemy's sword, I have not wished to neglect to explain the manner in which one should proceed to close in and seize it; and first, when wishing to close in from within, as from without, according to the occasion, one must first seize it from a distance, about a span from the tip, which if it happens that one must close in from within, the tip of the sword should point towards the enemy's right shoulder, and if from without, it should point towards his left shoulder; having done this, one will walk towards the enemy's sword, which, should he draw it at that moment, will be countered by returning the sword to its place, or else with the same countering, he will be wounded in the act of drawing.

[140] (P167.S2)
Moreover, if it should happen that the Adversary comes to bind the sword, both from within and from without, which is found in plain sight, in a straight line with the arm extended, at that moment one shall withdraw and bind while advancing; and if it is necessary to withdraw to bind from within, one shall bring the right foot forward into the withdrawal, bending the body towards your right side, bringing the left hand close to the right and then passing with the left foot, one shall strike in the fourth with the point to the chest; and if one must withdraw to bind from without, one shall similarly bring the right foot forward, bending the body towards your left side, and passing with the left foot, one shall strike in the second to the chest.

[141] (P167.S3)
Warning further that the following figures show how to grip the sword from the outside with the third, you shall maintain the order in gaining the sword from the Adversary, as has been said above.

[142] (P168.S0)
[66] THE PRESENT AND FOLLOWING FIGURES SHOW DIFFERENT WAYS OF STRIKING FROM WITHIN, always presupposing the tightening from the outside and the digging into your Opponent to strike.

[143] (P168.S1)
The following figures show various ways to strike from within, always presupposing the tightening from outside your side and that of your Opponent to draw forth to wound you: drawing D. as above, C. will strike him with a fourth from a firm foot or with an advancing step to the throat and the face.

[144] (P168.S2)
But if D. had been an intelligent person, when he would have disengaged, he would have struck with the edge of the enemy's sword, giving a thrust to the face or a reverse to the arm at the marked figure C., retreating into third with an ordinary step.

[145] (P169.S0)
[68] FIGURE THAT STRIKES WITH THE ESCAPE OF THE RIGHT FOOT NEAR THE EAR.

[146] (P169.S1)
Having the figure marked C. tight from outside the figure marked B.

[147] (P169.S2)
And this figure, striking to wound from the fourth, the figure marked C., the same figure noted C. wounds with the crossing of the right foot traversed outside by his sword to the face near the ear.

[148] (P169.S3)
However, I shall not fail to say that if B. had been a practical person, he would have drawn the sword in feint, with his body somewhat held back and coming at C. surely to strike with the right foot crossed over B.'s figure. B., facing the enemy's sword from the outside, lowering the point in second and passing with the left leg at the same time, would wound him in the side, taking hold of the sword's hand.

[149] (P170.S0)
[ 69a ] FIGURE THAT STRIKES FROM THE QUARTER TO THE THROAT WITH THE LEFT FOOT IN PASSING.

[150] (P170.S1)
Having the figure marked C, draw the sword outward to the figure B.

[151] (P170.S2)
And the same figure B. withdrawing to deliver a thrust to the face of figure C., C. wounds him while withdrawing in fourth to the throat or face, as the figure shows; but if B. had been a practiced person, he would have withdrawn the sword as a feint with the waist held somewhat back, and as C. confidently came to pass with the fourth, B. by quartering with the shift of the waist, passing with the left leg behind the right, would wound him in the chest.

[152] (P171.S0)
[70] FIGURE THAT STRIKES FROM THE QUARTER WITH THE ESCAPE OF LIFE, CARRYING THE LEFT LEG CROSSED BEHIND THE RIGHT.

[153] (P171.S1)
And having gained the sword from outside the figure D. by figure C., and D. thrusting to give a point to the face of figure C., C. wounds him in the fourth with the evasion of the body, passing with the left leg behind the right, crossing, as the figure demonstrates.

[154] (P171.S2)
But if D. had been a practical person, he would have seized to gain the sword from within the figure C., by bending his body towards his right side, and having gained it, he would suddenly step forward with his left foot, delivering a thrust of fourth to the chest, or he would have seized with a half-cut, striking the enemy's sword, delivering a backhand to C.'s face, retreating into third, and thus he would have been safe.

[155] (P172.S0)
[72] FIGURE THAT STRIKES SECONDLY BY PASSING IN THE FACE, GRASPING with the left hand the arm of the enemy's sword.

[156] (P172.S1)
FOR the declaration of the following figures, having engaged from the outside C. the adversary, which is the figure D., and the same figure D. withdrawing to deliver a thrust to the figure C., the same figure C. parries from the fourth with the strike of the right foot the enemy's sword, all at once, passing and turning well the waist, he will strike him with a second blow in the face, although this can also be done without passing, striking him from the fourth in just two times.

[157] (P172.S2)
But if D. had been a practical person in the art of swordplay, when C. drew to parry from the fourth with the strike of the right foot to the figure of D., D. would have counter-drawn his sword from the outside, wounding him in the face with a second strike, retreating backward into the third, continuing in such retreat with his sword against the enemy's sword, and thus C. would have been left wounded.

[158] (P173.S0)
[74] FIGURE OF THE SWORD AND DAGGER WHICH SHOW YOU THE WAY TO GRASP THE SWORD OF THE OPPONENT, finding yourself in the high guard inside, warning you that if the point of the enemy's sword is directed towards your right shoulder, you must find it from the outside, and you will hold the same manner in gaining the low guards.

[159] (P173.S1)
The following figures show the play of sword and dagger, and primarily teach the way to grip the opponent's sword while in high guard, noting that in a single figure it is not possible to show all the ways to grip from outside and inside, from low and high, leaving this to the reader's description; only warning that if the point of the enemy's sword is directed towards your right side, you will find it from the outside, and moreover, when you need to grip the low guards, you will grip with the sword in a perpendicular line, both with the third and with the fourth.

[160] (P174.S0)
[76] FIGURES THAT SHOW HOW WITH A SINGLE GUARD OF THE PUGNALE ONE CAN STRIKE IN THREE POINTS, namely in the face, in the chest, and in the thigh.

[161] (P174.S1)
These following figures show you an artful manner of striking in three different ways, with a thrust, using a single parry of the dagger, which is done in such a way that having seized the opponent in the inside fourth from any guard suitable for closing in, you will be able to draw forth to strike you in two ways, in the face and in the chest. Therefore, having drawn to wound you, you will parry from the inside with your dagger against his sword above your right arm, and at the first opportunity, you will be able to wound him high or low, that is, in the face or beneath the arm in the chest or in the thigh, and in the second instance, only in the face and in the thigh.

[162] (P175.S0)
[ 78 ] FIGURE THAT STRIKES FROM THE SECOND OF FANCY IN THE CHEST BETWEEN THE ARMOR, CUTTING FROM ABOVE WITH THE dagger, and it could also strike in the same manner from the fourth.

[163] (P175.S1)
When the adversary turns in low third with the arm retracted and the dagger forward, joined with the sword, you will meet him in high third, feinting in high fourth or in the same third from outside the dagger towards the face, and while he raises the dagger to parry and strike you in fourth, you will draw over his dagger and, at the same time parrying from the inside, you will wound him in second in the chest.

[164] (P176.S0)
[80] A FIGURE THAT STRIKES ONLY THE RIGHT ARM IN THE CHEST AND MAKES THE SWORD FALL WITH THE THRUST OF THE SWORD AND THE DAGGER.

[165] (P176.S1)
From these figures, you will easily be able to understand and learn the way to throw the sword from the hand, while also delivering a thrust to the chest at the same time. That is, finding yourself in the third position with your arm withdrawn and the dagger joined with the sword, while the opponent is in the same guard or in the fourth, you will begin to press inward against his sword in the fourth and let your dagger drop in the middle of your right arm in an oblique line. As the opponent attempts to strike you in the chest from the fourth, you will wound him with the reverse point on the outside at the waist, slightly raising the hilt of your sword, and at the same time, by parrying with the flat of your dagger from above downward, you will force him to abandon his weapon.

[166] (P177.S0)
[82] FIGURE THAT FOR A HIGH THRUST FROM WITHIN AND STRIKES FROM THE REVERSE ON THE THIGH AND FROM THE FOURTH ON THE CHEST, AS THE FIGURES SHOW.

[167] (P177.S1)
When you find yourself in the fourth position with the dagger held high, while your adversary stands in any guard ready to close in, with your right leg forward, you will begin to close in on him in the fourth position. As he attempts to strike you in the face with a fourth, you, parrying from the inside with your dagger above your right arm, will be able to wound him either with a reverse strike to the thigh or indeed with a fourth strike beneath the arm.

[168] (P178.S0)
[ 84 ] FIGURE THAT WITH THE SWORD OF QUARTA ACCOMPANIED BY THE PUGNALE AND STRIKES HIM OF QUARTA IN THE FACE, or with a reverse in the arm as the figure shows.

[169] (P178.S1)
And if by chance you find yourself in the third position with the dagger at the wrist of your hand, while the opponent is in any guard ready to strike from the outside, you shall begin to press him with the same third, now high, now low, according to the occasion, without moving the dagger from its place, and drawing the opponent to strike you in the fourth or in the second, parrying in the fourth with the sword accompanied by the dagger, you will be able to wound him as you see, either with a reverse strike to the arm or with a fourth strike to the face.

[170] (P179.S0)
[86] FIGURE THAT MAKES THE FEINT ABOVE THE PUGNALE AND RAISING THE OPPONENT TO PARRY IT, WOUNDS HIM BY DRIVING THE SWORD UPWARD FROM BELOW THE FOURTH INTO THE CHEST.

[171] (P179.S1)
When you find yourself in a third guard with the dagger at the wrist of your hand, while the opponent stands in a low fourth guard, with his sword withdrawn and his dagger extended high, you will begin to feint above his dagger in third guard, keeping your dagger in its place. As he attempts to strike upward with his dagger, intending to wound you at the same time in fourth or second guard, you will draw from below and, while parrying his blow, you will wound him in the chest with a fourth strike.

[172] (P180.S0)
[ 88 ] FIGURE THAT FOR THE PUGNALE UNDER HIS RIGHT ARM AND STRIKES SECOND IN THE FACE, ALSO LIKE A STRAMAZZONE FALLING BACK INTO THE ARM OF THE SWORD.

[173] (P180.S1)
When you find yourself in low or high third, with the dagger at the wrist of your hand, and the opponent in any guard positioned to strike from the outside, you will begin to strike from the outside in high or low third, according to the occasion, raising the dagger. And if he wishes to thrust from the inside and strike in fourth or second, you, by parrying with the dagger down under the arm of your sword, will deliver a blow to his arm, or you will wound him in second to the face, as is demonstrated.

[174] (P181.S0)
[90] FIGURE THAT STRIKES ABOVE THE PUNCTURE OF SECOND IN THE LEFT SHOULDER, WHILE THE adversary seeks to gain the sword from the outside.

[175] (P181.S1)
IF you find yourself in a third position with the dagger in an oblique line, upon the beginning of the strong of your sword, while the opponent is in the same guard, as he comes to press from outside also in third, you will draw and strike in fourth with your sword at the same time as his, and immediately parrying with the dagger the sword already pressed, you will wound him at the same time above his dagger in the left shoulder.

[176] (P182.S0)
[92] FIGURE THAT STRIKES FROM THE SECOND ABOVE THE DUMMY ON THE LEFT SHOULDER, as he defends with his dagger from above downwards, beneath his right arm.

[177] (P182.S1)
And being in third or in fourth with your arm withdrawn, with the dagger at the wrist of your hand, while the adversary stands in fourth with the sword withdrawn and the dagger high extended, you will make the feint under his dagger, raising yours and parrying as he brings his dagger down towards his left side; at the same time, you will strike above his dagger: by parrying the enemy's sword beneath your right arm, you will wound him with a second strike above his dagger.

[178] (P183.S0)
[94] A FIGURE THAT STRIKES WITH A PASSING THRUST FROM BELOW TO ABOVE IN THE CHEST, PARAN with his dagger over his right arm, firmly gripping the weapon together.

[179] (P183.S1)
When the adversary finds himself in the third guard with both weapons extended in an oblique line, such that the tip of the enemy's sword points towards your right shoulder and that of the dagger towards your left, you will meet him in the third guard with the tip of your sword low and your dagger high, bending your waist as much as possible towards your left side. And if he wishes to approach to bind you or for some other design, you will step with your left foot at the same time towards his right side, and, parrying with the dagger from the inside over your right arm, you will thrust a false point upward between his weapons, or indeed with both weapons, drawing with the sword from above, you will press down on his sword, wounding him in the third guard at the same time.

[180] (P184.S0)
[ 96 ] FIGURE THAT STRIKES FROM THE QUARTER TO THE THROAT ONLY BY DISPLACING THE SWORD AND LOWERING THE DAGGER FOR A GUARD, while the opponent draws his sword and seeks with the dagger to defend.

[181] (P184.S1)
When the adversary turns in high third with the dagger crossed and joined to the beginning of the strong of his sword, somewhat obliquely, you will bind him with the outer third with the high dagger, and as he withdraws below, helping himself to parry with the dagger from above down towards your lower parts, at the same time, by withdrawing beneath his dagger, you will wound him in fourth in the face or wherever it is most convenient for you.

[182] (P185.S0)
[98] FIGURE THAT STRIKES FROM THE QUARTER BELOW THE PUNGA IN THE CHEST, RETREATING THE RIGHT LEG AND STOPPING WITH THE DAGGER HIGH, while the opponent steps forward with his leg to strike from the second above the dagger.

[183] (P185.S1)
When the opponent is in low third, you will meet him in high third with the dagger united, crossed over your strong, and as he comes by to strike you in second from above your dagger and parrying wide with his, you will only need to withdraw your right leg back, and as he raises his dagger to parry, you will draw from under his, bringing your waist well forward, as the figure shows, and you will strike him in fourth.

[184] (P186.S0)
[100] FIGURE THAT STRIKES FROM THE SECOND ABOVE THE DAGGER IN THE CHEST, WHILE THE OPPONENT PASSES with the left foot to strike, merely by withdrawing the right leg back in his approach and parrying with the dagger under his right arm.

[185] (P186.S1)
When the adversary finds himself in fourth with the sword withdrawn and low, and with the dagger extended high and wide, you will meet him in fourth with your arm extended and the dagger high. As he moves to parry your sword from above to below in order to strike you from the side, you will withdraw your right leg back, parrying with the dagger down towards your right side, and you will draw your sword over his dagger: you will strike him from the side.

[186] (P187.S0)
[102] A FIGURE THAT STRIKES WITH ONE POINT THROUGH THE ARMS IN THE CHEST, DRAWING IT UPWARD WITH THE dagger while the opponent stands in a wide guard and allows the enemy to come within measure.

[187] (P187.S1)
When the opponent finds himself in the fourth guard with his arm withdrawn and the dagger held high, straight and wide, and with his arm extended, you will meet him in the extended third guard, with your dagger crossed before your chest, and you will approach from outside to his dagger, he also remaining in his guard; and when you have brought the tip of your sword level with his dagger, you will draw from the fourth guard above, delivering a long thrust to his chest.

[188] (P188.S0)
[ 104 ] WAY OF USING THE SWORD AND CAPE.

[189] (P188.S1)
In order that this matter of the cloak may be better understood, it may not be out of place to declare some terms that must be used with it.

[190] (P188.S2)
I tell you then that having the cloak around, it will be allowed to fall down from the right shoulder to the middle of the left arm, and then turning the left hand outward, wrapping the said cloak over the arm, placing oneself with it in third or in another guard, as you will please.

[191] (P188.S3)
As for the walking, one shall maintain that order which is held with the sword and dagger, for there is a same manner, except in the parrying due to the difference, since the cloak can be cut and pierced, which does not happen with the dagger.

[192] (P188.S4)
And finding yourself in the third position, as mentioned above, in response to your adversary, and if he strikes at you from above with a downward cut, you will at the same time step forward with your left foot, parrying with the forte of your sword against the enemy's blade, pushing a thrust into his chest; it is also possible to parry the aforementioned strike initially with the sword in the high guard accompanied by the cloak, gathering your left foot behind your right and then quickly stepping forward with your right to deliver a downward cut either to the head or to the leg; but when he strikes either downward or upward towards the leg, you will pull your right foot back slightly, and if it is a downward strike, you will deliver an upward cut to the arm of his sword, and if it is an upward strike, you will deliver a downward cut to the same arm; but the true parry will be to parry with the sword and then, in the act of striking, to accompany the sword with the cloak, by striking against the enemy's sword, and thus you will surely wound him.

[193] (P188.S5)
Furthermore, I say that the following figures demonstrate the manner in which one must hold to gain the sword from the adversary, in sword and cloak, from within.

[194] (P189.S0)
[ 106 ] FIGURE THAT STRIKES WITH A COUNTER-CUT OF THE FOURTH TO THE FACE, BLOCKING WITH THE ARM OF THE CAPE THE ENEMY'S SWORD OUTSIDE, WHILE THE OPPONENT DRAWS HIS SWORD TO STRIKE WITH THE POINT.

[195] (P189.S1)
When your adversary is in fourth with the sword extended and high, you will tighten it in fourth from the inside with the arm of the cloak under your strong: if he wishes to thrust to wound you in any manner, parrying with the cloak upwards, away from your left side, and counter-thrusting in fourth, you will strike him in the face or wherever it may be more convenient for you.

[196] (P190.S0)
[ 108 ] FIGURE THAT STRIKES WITH A REVERSED STRIKE TO THE FACE OF THE LEFT-HANDED, AND IT CAN STILL strike a second time to the chest or indeed from a fourth outside the enemy's sword, in the drawing that the point makes to strike.

[197] (P190.S1)
When the opponent, who will be on the left, finds himself in the fourth position with his arm extended, you will begin to close in from the inside with the third, with the dagger raised, against his sword. And as he attempts to strike you with a second from above to the face, you can wound him in three ways: first, by simply lowering the dagger and parrying his sword, you will strike him with a downward blow to the face, or indeed with a second to the chest, taking care, however, that in his attempt to strike, it would be better to wound him with a fourth using only the sword from the outside.

[ 110 ] FIGURE THAT TO STRIKE OVER THE HEAD WITH THE POINT OF THE SWORD HIGH AND WITH THE CROSSGUARD UNDERNEATH HIS SWORD IN THE STRONG, so that it may strike in two ways, first with a thrust to the face, or with a reverse to the leg.

[199] (P191.S1)
I would certainly do wrong to myself if I did not reveal to you such a noble guard, or true defense, which protects and saves such a noble part of life; therefore, on this occasion, I present to you the following figures, of which one is found in the first and the other in the fifth. And from the fifth, by merely raising the arm and turning the hand to the fourth, increasing the step, one will go to seize the sword from within the adversary. The enemy, drawing around under the hostile sword, will have struck a straight downward cut at the same time, but the same one, by merely turning the hand to the second with the point high, placing the dagger behind in the strong of his sword, can surely wound the adversary in two places: with the point in the face and with the edge in the legs, as well demonstrated by the two descending lines from the tip of the sword, one descending to the head and the other to the thigh.

[200] (P192.S0)
[ 112 ] FIGURE THAT STRIKES WITH THE POINT OF THE THIRD IN THE THIGH AND WITH THE PUGNALE IN THE SIDE, WHILE THE adversary draws the reverse through the leg to strike.

[201] (P192.S1)
FOR some, seeing this figure wounded with the sword and also with the dagger may seem difficult; however, by trying the same method, it will become easy through explanation. Thus, I say that when both adversaries find themselves in the fourth position with the true edge of their swords touching, and the points of each one watching the face of the adversary, the same was compelled, pressing with his sword against the enemy's sword. Feeling the adversary press, he turned to deliver a thrust to the leg, but the same, suddenly lowering the sword and turning the hand into the third position, passed with the left leg forward, wounding him while parrying with the sword and also with the dagger, as the figure shows.

[202] (P193.S0)
[ 114 ] FIGURE THAT FOR THE STRA MAZZONE REVERSED WITH THE SWORD AND WITH THE PASSING IN ONE SUDDEN WITH THE LEFT FOOT FORWARD, GIVING HIM A STAB UNDER THE ARM, INTO THE POCKET.

[203] (P193.S1)
FOR this reason, great account is made, when the adversary thrusts a point, to parry it with the dagger, both from within and from without, and to turn a winding strike back into the arm of the enemy's sword, so that when you thrust at your adversary it is parried from within, towards your left side, and the said winding strike turns you, you will parry with the sword in third from without, suddenly stepping forward with your left leg, placing your dagger upon the enemy's sword, you will strike him in second with the point in the chest.

[204] (P193.S2)
But for the explanation of the following figures, I say that when the adversary finds himself in third with the dagger in the strong of his sword and the other in the seventh guard, with the arm of the dagger extended before him and with the sword somewhat low and withdrawn to himself, he will have thrust a point above his dagger; and the enemy, parrying outward towards his left side, responds with a reverse strike, but at that moment, parrying in fourth and stepping forward with the left foot, he wounds him with the dagger, as shown in the figure, and wishing to retreat, he will withdraw the said left leg, simultaneously delivering a reverse strike with the arm of the sword to the adversary, returning to the same guard.

[ 116 ] WAY TO KNOW HOW TO WELL VALUE ONESELF WITH THE SHIELD WHEN ENCOUNTERING ANOTHER SHIELD.

[206] (P194.S1)
And since it often happens that one's own weapons wage war against those who do not know how to wield them well, I have deemed it not out of place to point out some particulars of the rotella, as it is a most dangerous weapon for those who have not practiced with it in some manner; and therefore it is to be noted that the Rotella should be held with the left arm somewhat bent, so that it looks somewhat towards your left side, but not so bent that it hinders the eye from seeing any part of the enemy; and having done this, if you wish to strike, finding the enemy with his sword extended in a tight guard, you must first bind the enemy's sword either inside or outside, according to the occasion, and then, stepping forward with the left foot, strike with the rotella against the already gained sword and wound with a third, with the ascending point.

[207] (P194.S2)
But if it should happen that the enemy finds himself in a wide guard and strikes straight or reverse to the leg, one must parry with the false, both the straight and the reverse, and then respond with a cut to the opponent's legs; but if by chance he strikes with the point or with a cut towards the face or the head, one can parry with the Rotella, provided that the cut or point comes without feint.

[208] (P194.S3)
But to ensure against the feint, since the Shield is heavy, one cannot be as quick to parry with it as one would be with a targe or buckler; therefore, it is advised not to parry in any way with the Shield, for the very same figure, when attempting to parry a thrust that comes from the adversary outside of his Shield, must necessarily obstruct his view, and thus hindered, at that moment the enemy will have the opportunity to step forward with his left foot and strike, without the motion of his sword being seen, to the chest or indeed to the foot of the body, as the figures demonstrate.

[209] (P194.S4)
But she will stop in second or fourth, according to the occasion, with the sword and then, advancing with the left step, strike with the Shield the enemy's sword: she will wound in third with an ascending point, and thus will be more secure.

[210] (P195.S0)
[ 118 ] FIGURE THAT STRIKES UNDER THE SHIELD WHILE THE OPPONENT SEEKS TO BLOCK WITH THE SAME SHIELD TO STAB IN THE CHEST.

[211] (P195.S1)
FOR the tricks and feints that are found in Arms, one must be very attentive when one finds oneself in hand-to-hand with one's enemy, so that by the declaration of the following figures I demonstrate how parrying is often harmful, when one parries and does not respond at the same time. Thus, I also demonstrate this in the matter of the Shield: when one of them finds himself in the fifth guard with the arm hanging and the point of the sword low, with the Shield before the chest, and the enemy is in the sixth guard with the arm of the Shield extended forward and the sword somewhat back, so that if he approaches within measure, thrusting a point from the Shield towards the face, and he, raising the Shield to parry, will have obscured his vision and at the same time, by lowering the sword beneath the Shield, he strikes him in the fourth manner as shown in the figure.

[212] (P195.S2)
But if he had been a practical person, when the adversary thrust the point at his face, he would have parried by extending the arm of the Shield and stepping forward with the left foot, suddenly bending the body and head toward his right side, delivering a thrust to the chest; or when the adversary thrust, he could have parried with the sword in the fourth guard, and in an instant stepping forward with the left foot and striking with the Shield against the enemy's sword, he would have wounded him with an ascending thrust to the belly, and thus he would have been safe.

[213] (P196.S0)
[ 120 ] OF SOME TERMS OF THE CUT I had resolved among myself to present to you some figures that would show you the way of fencing, both in parrying and in striking, and in this action to show you many effects. However, considering that what I could do with the figures, I can also do with these few pieces of advice that I propose to you; that is, when the adversary finds himself in third or in fourth, with the point of his sword aimed at your torso, you will meet him in fourth, with the point of your sword somewhat high and angled towards your right side, and as you approach the adversary's sword, you will deliver a thrust to his sword, accompanied by a descending cut to the face; conversely, when the enemy executes a descending cut to the face, you will pass by parrying with your dagger in a guard position above your right arm, giving him a thrust in third to the chest; or, if you are in guard, passing as above, you can deliver a thrust to the leg; furthermore, you can also parry the said descending cut with the sword in fourth, as shown in that figure which strikes with the dagger under the adversary's arm, and passing and parrying with the dagger, he will be struck with a descending cut to the legs, or with the dagger in the same manner to the belly; moreover, you can also position yourself in fourth with the point of the sword low, showing him somewhat of your torso, and when he comes from the outside to thrust at you, you will parry with the false edge of the sword upwards, giving him a thrust to the face, or a thrust to the chest; but if the adversary comes to you to strike the sword, both from the inside and from the outside, you will do as follows: if he delivers a thrust to the sword, you will at the same time execute a descending cut to the face, and if he were to deliver a descending cut from the outside to strike the sword, you will at the same time deliver a thrust to the face: be aware that the parry of the thrust, as well as of the descending cut to the head, will be parried in the same manner as shown in that figure which parries with the sword crossed with the dagger from behind, in the strong of the sword, which has two lines, one descending to the face and the other to the thigh; and when the occasion arises that the adversary strikes you either with a thrust or a descending cut to the lower parts, you will parry in second with the point of the sword low, and if it is a thrust, you will parry and cut with the edge over the enemy's sword, placing your dagger over the said sword, delivering a descending cut to the arm, and if it is a descending cut, you will parry outward in the same manner, giving him a thrust to the chest, placing the dagger at the same time over the adversary's sword; and this is all that I needed to say regarding this.

[214] (P197.S0)
[ 121 ] A SURE WAY TO DEFEND ONESELF FROM EVERY SORT OF STRIKE WITH A REVERSED GUARD and to always wound with a thrust.

[215] (P197.S1)
In concluding this my work, it has not seemed out of place to seal it with this brief discourse of mine, which consists solely in demonstrating the virtue and action of the first and fourth guards, finding in the first the offense and in the fourth the defense, the beginning and end of any honorable endeavor; given that the fourth defends against any decisive or indecisive strike, and the first offends the adversary, it is therefore necessary to say (for being both most faithful companions) that the beginning of one is the end of the other, and thus without beginning and end they go on beginning and ending, since the first begins high and ends in the fourth somewhat low. This is for two reasons: first, because if the adversary strikes with the point or with the edge, stepping somewhat with the left foot in the parry, with a reverse towards the right side of the adversary, pushing with the right foot one can wound with a thrust to the chest, and with such an end one returns to the fourth guard; second, because the adversary can only offend the right side, which is easily defended with the ascent of said fourth, demonstrating in such actions boldness in the face, a keen eye to recognize the uncovered and covered parts of the adversary, strength and readiness in the legs, arms, and hands, quickness in parrying and striking, and agility in the body; and this is the nature of the first and fourth guard.
