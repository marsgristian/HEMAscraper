[ 49 ] OF THE SWORD AND CAPE.

[2] (P133.S1)
TO continue with the most commonly used weapons, with which a man finds himself more easily, after the dagger I come to the sword, the use of which was first discovered by chance, and then reduced to art; and this not for any other reason, but because Nature not only intends to generate things, but also to preserve the generated, and for this reason she takes all those things that are convenient to her in her aid.

[3] (P133.S2)
Where [50] having tested men in various Accidents, it has been the head that has greatly aided them, which they must carry at all times, they have imagined to avail themselves of all that it can serve them, which accidents being infinite, and not all pertaining to our purpose, I shall restrict myself to speaking only of those that belong to this art, which are also so many and such that they can bring great joy and assured victory, if one finds a man who knows how to avail himself of them; truly, for the true art, we can make little use of them, as the use of the head is almost entirely deceptive; hence, I was almost resolved to defer all this treatise to deception, as to its proper place.

[4] (P133.S3)
However, so that it does not seem strange to anyone not to see in the true treatise anything regarding the head, I have wanted to place within the usual guards a few strikes, reserving to speak of them later in detail regarding the deception, and as it is fitting.

[5] (P134.S0)
OF THE WAY TO USE THE CAPE.

[6] (P134.S1)
HAVING the cape in itself three things to rely on in this art, namely length, width, and flexibility, it must be inasmuch as those extend to serve, of which one is, as its own, that is flexibility, which cannot be increased nor diminished, the other two can undergo alteration.

[7] (P134.S2)
But however, if one must strive in every instance not to diminish, nor these other two; for the head is not a thing so strong that it can withstand the blows of the sword, opposing them directly.

[8] (P135.S0)
Where foolish is he who, securing himself with the unblemished cloth around his arm; for having in that part no point of flexibility, which is its strength, little does the length and width serve him in such a manner around a solid body.

[9] (P135.S1)
But by opposing it in that part which has length, width, and flexibility, which is from the arm down, at that time, all three together will defend against every cut, which defense would not be so secure if the cloak had only length and flexibility, for having little air behind it from a great blow oppressed and cut; thus, if there is time, one must turn the cloak once or twice around the arm, taking it by the hood, covering the arm up to the elbow, and with it, protect against all cuts from the flank behind, both from the right side and from the left, being careful always to keep the foot differently from the arm so as not to go into danger by bringing it to the same side, bringing the leg close to the cloak, and remaining wounded, for the cloak does not defend when there is a solid body behind it;

[10] (P136.S0)
The points can also be drawn out if one goes to strike the enemy's sword or with the cloak or with the hand in the cloak turned, but a hand's breadth after the point, for not having in that case the edge any violence, it is not powerful in that little time to cut the cloak and wound the hand.

[11] (P136.S1)
The thrusts then, both from the point and from the edge from the side upwards, must be parried with the sword, for raising the arm so high, being burdened by the weight of the cloak, naturally pulls it down; moreover, it is a violent act and there is danger in placing the arm in the way of the cloak, and being grievously wounded, or placing the arm or the cloak before the eyes and becoming blinded.

[12] (P137.S0)
WARNING ABOUT THE STOPPING WITH THE CAPE, AND TO TAKE IT UP.

[13] (P137.S1)
There are two ways to now embrace the cloak; one, when there is time, one takes the cloak by the hood and wraps it once or twice around the arm.

[14] (P137.S2)
Another thing that often happens is when, letting the cloak fall from the shoulder, it is casually taken from one side and is wrapped around the arm one or more times.

[15] (P138.S0)
As for striking, in this art one should only grow to strike by bringing one foot close to the other, then growing, that is, with a half step and not with a whole step, as in other arms, because in this art there is danger; growing the whole step may entangle the foot or the feet in the cloak and cause a fall. This should be observed in the first and second grips, but mainly in the second, as in that one the cloak is longer and therefore more easily touches the ground and entangles the feet.

[16] (P138.S1)
In the first instance, if the cloak does not touch the ground, holding it with the arm duly, yet in it, too, due to fatigue the arm lowers and has the same effect.

[17] (P139.S0)
[ 54 ] OF THE OFFENSE OF HIGH GUARD with sword & cloak.

[18] (P139.S1)
WE SHALL FORM in this manner of arms as in the others, three guards, and the first for the reason mentioned will be the high guard, which in this quality of arms more than in any other merits the name of guard, because the sword somewhat bent defends up to the hand of the head and from there down to the middle of the leg, so that in this guard the man finds himself defended from the top of the head down to the feet.

[19] (P139.S2)
Finding oneself in this guard, either with the right foot forward or backward, one can strike with the point by advancing a half step while establishing oneself in a low guard.

[20] (P140.S0)
DEFENSE OF POINT STRAIGHT AND REVERSED from high guard.

[21] (P140.S1)
TO AVOID the attacks that may arise from the high guard, it is necessary to find oneself in the low guard, in which one can in four ways ward off the point, that is, either with the sword alone from inside and outside, or with the cloak alone from inside and outside.

[22] (P140.S2)
If one wishes to defend with the sword alone, it will be necessary to turn the foot behind to the right while similarly turning the body in that direction, in order to move away from the straight line in which one is struck, simultaneously thrusting a reverse point aimed at the face. This point, treated in this manner, is the longest that there is; and with this, not only is the offense avoided, but at the same time, the enemy is struck in the face.

[23] (P140.S3)
It happens that when the sword is encountered from the outside, it is not only useful but necessary to step forward and, with the cloak, meet the sword and strike with a thrust from below using the rise of the right foot.

[24] (P140.S4)
And although it has been commanded not to use a full step in the cover, this should be understood in the offenses where, focusing solely on striking with the sword, it may easily happen that a man, forgetting the cover, lowers his arm, and thus comes to meet his feet in the same line. However, in defense, this does not occur, because nature, intent on preserving itself, raises both arms at the slightest hint of danger, even if they were weighed down.

[25] (P141.S0)
Where it is not to be feared that in the defense of this thrust, the hand is pulled down by the weight of the cape,

[26] (P142.S0)
The same defenses can be made with the sole cloak, striking then similarly with the growth of the right foot.

[27] (P142.S1)
But this defense is not very secure because it requires great quickness and judgment, as one must hold the cape with the arm extended forward and avert it when the enemy's point has passed within the hand of the cape by a span or a little more, not allowing it to pass further, but rather to push it and grow to strike with a low thrust, with the advancement of the right foot. However, as I have said, this defense is of little security and great risk, but it strikes well in a shorter time.

[28] (P143.S0)
The thrust can likewise be defended with either the sword or the cloak, but when it comes too high, it will not be useful to counter it with the cloak alone, for it would cover one's own eyes, which I leave to others to judge how important that is. But when the straight cut comes in such a low manner that one can defend and see the enemy, then one must oppose the cloak with the advance of the left foot, and thereafter immediately thrust with the advance of the right foot.

[29] (P144.S0)
And when the sole sword opposes this right, one must thrust the point to the face and turn the back foot, cutting in reverse to the face, establishing oneself in wide guard; and the same is done wanting to defend oneself with both together, that is, sword and cloak.

[30] (P145.S0)
In the Reversal, the same defenses are used, either with one, or with the other, or with both.

[31] (P146.S0)
With the cloak, advancing the step and going to meet the enemy sword more forward than is possible, so that one can comfortably strike then with the point from below with the advance of the right step,

[32] (P147.S0)
With the sole sword, it will suffice that cover which is given in the sole sword to thrust the point to the thigh, which quiets the fall of the counter.

[33] (P148.S0)
If one wishes to defend oneself with both these weapons, one must also grow the right step and, affirming with the cloak the enemy's sword, swiftly draw one's own and strike with the point while still advancing with the right step.

[34] (P149.S0)
[ 57 ] OFFENSE OF WIDE GUARD.

[35] (P149.S1)
In this guard, just as in the others, one can strike with thrusts and cuts, but differently, for one should not only thrust straight and the Reverse is manifestly perilous; therefore, when one must thrust, it shall be done in this manner.

[36] (P150.S0)
First, one shall thrust the point while slightly turning the back foot to extend it further, and then immediately, without pausing, shall move and draw the straight line, from which one must quickly follow with the reverse, with the advancement of the right step, continuing all the while with the prepared point along with the advancement of the right step.

[37] (P151.S0)
DEFENSE OF WIDE GUARD.

[38] (P151.S1)
To defend oneself surely from the offense of the wide guard, it is necessary to find oneself in the low guard, in which, standing and coming, the thrust will push a point to the face, turning the back foot to the right, with which point it can easily happen that one strikes the enemy in the face. But when the thrust misses, the enemy cannot achieve his intent to wound with the point of the wide guard, because in striking with the low point and turning the back foot, the line of the straight path is already taken away. Therefore, immediately pushing the point to the face, if the enemy is not struck, but the sword has passed behind the head, then one must turn to the reverse to the face, withdrawing the foot and establishing oneself in the wide guard to protect both the forehand and the backhand. At that time, one must thrust either to the thigh or to another place that may cause greater impediment and harm, although I do not believe that there is anyone so foolish as to strike from this reverse guard alone.

[39] (P152.S0)
[ 58 ] OF THE OFFENSE OF low guard.

[40] (P152.S1)
The VESTA guard is so tight and perilous that one should not assure anyone of striking with the edge in any way, for beneath each of them one can easily be wounded, and from above both can be easily defended. Therefore, every diligence should be used to strike with the point only, which should never be attempted unless first with one's own sword the enemy's sword is found, and more so than is possible.

[41] (P152.S2)
Finding it thus, one can strike with the point, from within and from without; no other advantage can be had in this than to seek to steal a half-step that the enemy does not perceive, which is very well done, considering that the cover occupies the view. And having withdrawn this half-step, and finding the sword, one should increase their half-step forward to strike the enemy; by edging the enemy's sword and pushing it aside so that it cannot harm. This will be used from within and from without, but for those who wish and do not fear entangling in the cover, one can, finding oneself from within, take the left step and between their cover and sword, strike the enemy's sword, and then strike with the point by increasing the right step and finding the enemy's sword from outside to make the same increase and strike.

[42] (P152.S3)
But if it should not happen to find the enemy's sword, one can make a small cut of the knot, so that no time is given to the enemy to enter, and having found it, immediately go to strike either with a direct thrust, or without a point abandon the enemy's sword, with the advancement of the left step pushing a point from high to low, raising the fist somewhat high, and then thrusting it with the advancement of the right step.

[43] (P153.S0)
OF THE DEFENSE OF low guard.

[44] (P153.S1)
TO DEFEND oneself from all the points in the offense described, one must not, nor perhaps can, do anything other than flee with the life from the straight line in which the enemy intends to strike, taking a somewhat sideways step to the left, and wounding the enemy safely, which does not happen by defending with the cloak or sword alone, for while attending to defend oneself, one cannot offend, and the enemy having first moved to strike straight, the sword is not drawn very far, which is difficult to achieve; yet one can, with a run of a few steps, thrust with force. Therefore, it must be noted that when the enemy moves to strike, one should take a diagonal step and lift oneself from the offense, and then, with the increase of the right straight step, strike him with a low thrust.

[45] (P154.S0)
And here it suffices as to what can be said of this weapon regarding the safe play; all that remains to be said will be reserved for deception, in which place one will see many strikes of the head, no less useful than delightful.
