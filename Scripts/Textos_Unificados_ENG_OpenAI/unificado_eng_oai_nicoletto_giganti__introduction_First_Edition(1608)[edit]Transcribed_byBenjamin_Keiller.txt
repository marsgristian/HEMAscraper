READERS.

[3] (P108.S2)
Since in my first book I have dealt with the art of thrusting with a firm foot, and with feints, and taught how to parry all the thrusts.

[4] (P108.S3)
I have thought in this my second intention to be more universal; I wish to teach about various kinds of weapons, and more necessary ones, furthermore, how to defend against every sort of knife thrust, how one should strike, the manner of stepping, and all in accordance with what I promised you in my first Book.

[5] (P108.S4)
And it is necessary that one who wishes to become perfect in the profession of arms not only knows how to thrust well, make a fine feint, and execute a passing step, both right and left; but also knows the opposite of all these things, that is, knows how to parry gracefully.

[6] (P108.S5)
Given that one who knows how to thrust well, knows how to make a pass, and then has a flaw in knowing how to parry it, can be said to know nothing, for if he engages in a contest with another who can thrust as he does; both will be wounded.

[7] (P108.S6)
It is good to know how to thrust and make a pass, but it is much better to know how to parry, as we shall discuss in this Book.

[8] (P108.S7)
Moreover, one who is a skilled man in thrusting and cutting, and who also knows how to parry every kind of cut and thrust: but is deficient in delivering and parrying knife strikes; it must be understood that he knows nothing, for if he finds himself in a dispute with someone who does not know how to play with the sword, as today most of them do, he will need to know how to parry knife strikes, since those who do not know instinctively throw many knife strikes.

[9] (P108.S8)
And if indeed one, who knows how to thrust, engages in a contest with one of these who do not know, he gives him a thrust, while the other at the same time delivers a knife stab: hence both will strike each other, and as many thrusts will be delivered by the one who knows how to thrust, so many knife stabs will the other deliver, either to the head or to the legs, thus trained by nature.

[10] (P108.S9)
Thus both would be in danger, and therefore it is not enough to know how to thrust, but it is also very useful to know how to parry the cuts.

[11] (P108.S10)
I therefore urge everyone who wishes to master this virtue of fencing to learn to thrust and cut with everything, furthermore, to properly parry the thrusts and cuts of all kinds.

[12] (P108.S11)
There are three types of knife thrusts that are delivered.

[13] (P108.S12)
The first are the coordinated knife strikes, which are learned from the Masters.

[14] (P108.S13)
The second are the natural knife strikes of those men who know nothing of this profession, who deliver certain blows so extravagant that they cannot be parried, except by those who have great practice in this art.

[15] (P108.S14)
To learn to parry these natural knife strikes, after you have learned to thrust and cut well, you must recognize the timing and measure, and know how to play with those who are skilled. You should begin to practice with those who know nothing, allowing them to strike in their own way, while you go to parry with the Sword or the Dagger, according to how they strike at you. You will strike back at the exposed side, and by playing with various men, you will come to master the parrying of the natural knife strikes.

[16] (P108.S15)
And therefore it is not a marvel that some good Fencers, engaging in discussion with those who know nothing, often touch them, that is to say because they have not practiced with those who know nothing, and thus do not know how to parry the natural strikes.

[17] (P108.S16)
The third type of knife thrust is the artificial ones, which are known in many ways, such as pretending to deliver a thrust in one place, and then delivering it in another, or also positioning oneself in some artificial guard and exposing oneself, so that the enemy strikes, and then thrusting, either with the point or with the edge.

[18] (P108.S17)
And we shall discuss all these kinds in this Book.
