[9] (P3.S1)
KING OF DENMARK, NORWAY, GOTHS, AND VANDALS, DUKE OF SLESWIG, HOLSTEIN, STORMARN, AND DITMARSH, COUNT OF OLDEMBURG, AND DELMENHORST, etc. I TRULY BELIEVE THAT WHOEVER reads this work of mine will recognize the multitude of benefits received from Your Serene Majesty; however, it is Your Most Illustrious Self who has been the one to excite and urge me to publish these labors of mine to the world, eager also to benefit the Professors of the science of arms by showing them those insights and rules that, through long practice, I have come to know as good, drawn from continuous training and from the sight and observation of the errors of others. With these foundations and reasons, I hope that the work will be praised, especially under the protection of Your Most Serene Majesty, for the excellence of the subject matter, so worthy and resplendent, having been approved by Your highest judgment. To you, however, as my supreme benefactor and Prince of incomparable worth, both in civil governance and in the handling of arms, and truly a Hero of our times, I have taken the courage to dedicate it, and as a product born of your virtue, to send it into the sight of men under the same protection of yours, knowing also how useful this necessary art is to the world for the good and honorable, whether in defense of the Prince, or of the Fatherland, or of the laws, or of oneâ€™s own life and reputation.

[10] (P3.S2)
Therefore, let the same Most Serene Majesty deign to receive not only the work, but also the devotion with which I, her humble and most obligated servant, dedicate it to her; for I shall continue to pray to Divine Goodness that she grants her long and happy years of life for the benefit of her most fortunate peoples, and the good of the World, and by means of grace to be able to serve her in other ways.

[ VIII ] TO THE READERS.

[18] (P4.S1)
DO NOT BE ALARMED, O READER, IF you see a man of the sword not accustomed to the schools, nor among the circles of the learned, who presumes to write and print books; rather, rejoice to see the science of arms and the skill of the sword reduced to rules and precepts, and like other arts in a disciplined form, whereby the curious and diligent knights may also learn teachings by turning the pages. And so much more should those knights rejoice, since, unlike the robed men and scholars, whose arts have never been transported from Theory to practice due to the noble rivalry of their ancient adversaries, now the knight converts the practical act into true theory, which should be given much greater faith, as he has said that he has written after having first seen a thousand experiences in himself and in others.

[19] (P4.S2)
Here you are, O reader, the present book of the science of arms adorned with figures, fertile in the proposal of cases, to them, as mute images give breath, and our words, those will be demonstrative, and these interpretative of the effects and reasons that are treated in this book, which we have written in our native Italian language, far from rhetorical flourishes and a certain elegance of speech, not ashamed to confess our little erudition, and with the example of a most famous captain of our century, to say that we could not, in our youth, hold the sword in the same hand. We believe we have sufficiently treated that which is required in this profession, having strived as much as we could to avoid obscurity and prolixity, although in such a subtle matter, it is a difficult thing to maintain the due brevity.

[20] (P4.S3)
We have left aside the use of geometric terms, although this profession has its foundations more in Geometry than elsewhere, and in a manner easy and rather natural than artificial, we have sought to make it accessible to everyone. And concerning what we have written or demonstrated, we do not seek praise or any reward, it never having been our intention to publish it to the world; but if there is anything worthy of praise within it, let it all be referred to the Most Serene Majesty of our Lord the King, by whose command this book comes to light in the world, and also by virtue of which we can say we have written it.

[21] (P4.S4)
Let us cease to speak of the nobility and excellence of this profession, which, being so clear and resplendent in itself, does not require our words; nor is there anyone so ignorant that they do not know that with this, kingdoms are defended, religions are expanded, injustices are avenged, and peace and happiness of the people are established.

[22] (P4.S5)
We only wish to remind that after the acquisition of such a precious virtue, a man should not become arrogant, nor use it violently to the detriment of others, but rather with moderation and justice should he employ it in all cases, awaiting the outcome of any victory not from his own hand, but rather from the most just will of God, who grants us pairs of His holy graces.
