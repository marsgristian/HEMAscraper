[1] (P23.S0)
[ 12r ] Â¶ Reason of the game of the sword.

[2] (P23.S1)
Chapter XI.

[3] (P23.S2)
When you are at half-sword, making the thrust or the reverse, you will make it take the direction of what I say once you are at the point: If you stand there, keep your eye ready and make the quick sight with cover, and hold the sword upright, for above your head the arms play.

[4] (P23.S3)
I cannot say in few words, for the effects are of the half sword.

[5] (P23.S4)
So that you may please more, when you seem fit, strike downwards, and slightly angle the sword away from you, pressing against that of your opponent.

[6] (P23.S5)
You make a good gain by well parrying all the blows.

[7] (P23.S6)
When you prepare the reverse, present the right foot forward, and as said, by stopping you the straight, then you will bring your weary foot forward.

[8] (P23.S7)
And you must also have your mind when you deliver the reverse descending strike, have the prudent eye so that the straight thrust does not come underneath.

[9] (P23.S8)
And if the companion weaves, and you from below, then making a sign to the head with the false edge and with cunning, as he raises it, strike the good reverse, and underneath to his arms across, then quickly recover the straight.

[10] (P23.S9)
And note also this: that you do not fail the reason of the art.

[11] (P23.S10)
If you draw the sword, then watch from your opponent's hand that he does not give you.

[12] (P23.S11)
Make your sword a downward strike to parry so that it does not catch you. And if it should then come to your desire to enter underneath and take its guard, and then do your duty, striking the pommel against its mustache, taking care that you do not get entangled.
