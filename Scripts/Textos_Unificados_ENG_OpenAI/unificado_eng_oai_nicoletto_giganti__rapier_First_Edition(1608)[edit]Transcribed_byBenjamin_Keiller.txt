[1] (P129.S0)
[ 55 ] AN ARTIFICIAL WAY
OF PARING WITH THE SWORD ALONE.

[2] (P129.S1)
In my first Book, I showed how one should approach the enemy with the sword alone, covering his sword, and while he draws his sword, to strike him.

[3] (P129.S2)
This figure now shows you another way to strike artfully, and it is this.

[4] (P129.S3)
Seeing your enemy in a guard with the sword before him, approach to close with yours as in the first figures of my first book, and if the enemy wishes to strike you, he will lower his sword, and while he lowers the sword, you raise the fist of your hand, and leave the guard, and the point of your sword, which you will give him in the side, which he will not be able to parry, because he thinks that you ought to parry with the fist low and the point high, and by doing as I have said, you will unexpectedly strike him.

[5] (P130.S0)
[57] ANOTHER ARTIFICIAL WAY OF STRIKING, CLOSING IN ON THE ENEMY FROM OUTSIDE THE SWORD.

[6] (P130.S2)
Go to bind the adversary's sword away from you with your sword upon his, and give him the opportunity to lower his sword to strike you, and while he lowers the sword, parry, raising the hilt of your hand, and lowering your waist and the point of your sword, as you see in the figure, for you will deceive him.

[7] (P130.S3)
After delivering the thrust, step back out of measure in the manner described.

[8] (P131.S1)
Anyone who wishes to perfect themselves in this profession must not only know how to carry their life well, defend properly, and master the sword, but must also know how to evade thrusts with their life, for one cannot always defend with the sword, and in case of necessity, one must evade with their life, being aware of the danger.

[9] (P131.S3)
It is done in this manner.

[10] (P131.S4)
Go to bind your enemy from outside with your sword upon his, and keep your body upright, and give him the opportunity to strike you with a thrust, and at the moment he draws his sword to strike you, quickly lower your body, for his thrust will go wide, and at that very moment, draw your sword under the hilt of the enemy's sword so that you will wound him in the side, as you see in the figure, and immediately place your left hand upon the hilt of the enemy's sword, and draw your sword so that you can strike, with two or three thrusts, and then quickly return to your usual measure.

[11] (P132.S0)
[ 61 ] THE WAY TO BLOCK THE THRUST BY AVOIDING WITH LIFE, MOVING TO CLOSE IN ON THE ENEMY FROM THE INSIDE.

[12] (P132.S1)
This other figure shows you that if you go to bind the adversary within the way of his sword, with your sword upon his, and with your body straight, it is necessary that if he wishes to strike you, he must lower his sword and turn the knot of his hand, to secure himself from your sword. Therefore, as soon as he lowers his sword to strike at your face, you lower your sword beneath his, and bend your body, so that you will hit him in the side; to his thrust, he will go empty, and immediately place your left hand upon the hilt of his sword, and strike, and salute him in the manner described above.

[13] (P133.S0)
[ 63 ] A WAY TO PARry, AND TO BE ABLE TO DELIVER A BACKHAND TO THE FACE, or indeed a thrust.

[14] (P133.S1)
This figure shows you an artful way to parry, and to be able to deliver a backhand strike to the face, or indeed a sure thrust in this manner.

[15] (P133.S2)
If your enemy is eager to strike with the point, and you yourself are in a guard with the sword forward, slightly uncover your chest, so that he may come to thrust; you parry with the strong of your sword, and step forward with your right foot, going to meet his sword, and accompany it to the ground with your outstretched arm, and with the strong of your sword, and of your body as you see in the figure, so that the enemy finds his face completely exposed, where you can immediately deliver a backhand strike to the face, and step back out of measure, avoiding, for it is necessary that while the adversary thrusts at you, you parry as above, and move forward, and while you deliver the backhand strike, step back, and do these two things at the same time; by parrying in this manner, you will be able to thrust and step back out of measure.

[16] (P134.S0)
[ 65 ] AN ARTIFICIAL WAY
TO PARry, AND TO GIVE A STRAIGHT
TO THE FACE, or rather a thrust.

[17] (P134.S1)
This figure shows you how to deliver a straight thrust, or a point to the face, and it is done in this manner.

[18] (P134.S2)
One must take a guard position and slightly expose the right side to provoke the enemy into thrusting at that uncovered part, or indeed, if you see the opponent in guard with the sword forward, move in to close the distance with your sword. And while he draws his sword, go to parry as described above, and as he draws his sword, step in with your foot, and with your arm extended, and with the strength of your shoulder and your whole body, guide the enemy's sword down to the ground, as shown in the figure, so that he will then be exposed to your face, and thus you can strike him with a direct blow to the face, or indeed a thrust, and then retreat out of measure, being careful to perform these actions simultaneously.

[19] (P135.S0)
[ 68 ] THE WAY TO BLOCK A PASS WITH THE LEFT FOOT AT A DISTANCE with the counter-caution.

[20] (P135.S1)
These figures, which you see one in a bent stance for passing, the other in a straight stance for parrying and striking, are very useful, as you will understand.

[21] (P135.S2)
If the enemy were to stand up less to strike you, and came to close in, to take the opportunity to pass, you should assume a guard on your right foot, with the sword forward, and expose your right shoulder, and give him the chance to pass, for he thinks that you will parry with the edge of the sword, and he relies on the quickness of delivering a thrust, that is, that his thrust will arrive before you have time to parry, and it would succeed every time, as long as he was within measure, or rather inside the measure, wherefore you must be careful not to let him come inside the measure, and as you see that he wants to pass, at that very moment draw your sword under the guards, while retreating a little with your body, accompanied by the sword, so that you will parry and strike at the same time, as you see in the figure, and immediately retreat out of measure, with your sword above his.

[22] (P136.S0)
[ 71 ] THE WAY TO STRIKE FOR THE LEG WITH THE SWORD ALONE SECURE.

[23] (P136.S1)
To strike the leg securely is done in many ways, as to say, feigning to deliver a cut to the head, and while the enemy goes to parry, strike at the leg, and one must not strike at the leg unless one sees that the enemy's sword has passed your life; otherwise, you would both be struck, and if your enemy were to strike at that time to the leg, he would hit you in the face, and he would save himself, as I have said in my first book.

[24] (P136.S2)
To want to give a sure strike to the leg, either from the right or from the reverse, one must feign the natural action of striking to the head, either from the right or with the point. And if you see that he does not appear to strike, strike resolutely, for it would not happen to strike other blows, neither to the leg nor to any other part. But if you see that he goes to parry, let his sword pass your life with the point, and immediately you strike to the leg, as you see in the figure, ensuring that the feint is with the point as well as with the edge, and the wounding and retreating, and saluting, are all done in the same instant.

[25] (P137.S0)
[ 73 ] THE WAY TO GO TO THE GRIPS AND STRIKE WITH THE POINT TO THE CHEST.

[26] (P137.S1)
We have shown many ways to parry and to strike with the sword alone, both in the first and in this second book, and it is necessary that we demonstrate how one fights when coming to grips, and how a man should defend himself.

[27] (P137.S2)
In this my second Book, I wish to teach you four solitary ways, from which many can be derived by intelligent men.

[28] (P137.S3)
The true and certain way to pass over the enemy to engage is either to pass inside the sword, or outside, or through the quarter as I have said in my first book.

[29] (P138.S0)
[ 75 ] A WAY TO GO TO GRAPPLING
and deliver a knife thrust to the head.

[30] (P138.S1)
This grip, which you see, is similar to the previous one in terms of the passing, for this too is done with the same passing.

[31] (P138.S2)
After you have passed, and both of you are on equal footing with your swords, you will place your left hand upon the fittings of the enemy's sword, breaking with your hand the arm of his sword, as the present figure shows you, and at the same time deliver a thrust to his head, which without a doubt he will be able to parry.

[32] (P138.S4)
To make these grips, it is essential to know how to take the right moment to pass securely, which can be taken in many ways; for example, exposing the right side and giving the enemy the opportunity to thrust, and immediately parrying with the strong of the sword, and stepping forward while directing the point of the sword towards the enemy's face. If he does not parry, he will receive a thrust to the face, and thus nothing else will happen. But if he does parry, you will be at sword's length, and you will come to grips where your sword's fittings will touch his, and then you will be able to execute all these four kinds of grips that I present in this Book.

[33] (P138.S5)
You can still go to bind your enemy outside of his sword, and step through with your foot, taking the time as previously mentioned, until you are equal with the swords, and then you will be in one of these four grips, whichever pleases you most.

[34] (P138.S6)
In another manner, you can also pass safely.

[35] (P138.S7)
Go to close in on your enemy from within, with your sword upon his, and give him the opportunity to draw his sword to strike you; and while he draws his sword, you will parry with the strong of the blade against the enemy's sword, and step forward with your foot, and thus if he does not parry, you will strike him in the face, and if he does parry, you will be with equal arms.

[36] (P138.S8)
As I have said, the act of making these grips consists in knowing how to choose the time to pass safely.

[37] (P139.S1)
This figure shows you that having taken the secure time in some manner of the aforementioned, and having come to grips, and passed with the foot, and standing with equal arms, you should draw the sword under the guards, and place your left hand inside the way of the guards, turning your arm and hand, taking with your hand the guards of your enemy's sword, as the figure shows, turning your arm to his, which must leave the sword, for while you turn the arm, you give him the thrust in the face, as you see in the figure, and from the shock of your sword, he loses the strength of his arm; hence he must leave the sword.

[38] (P140.S0)
[ 79 ] A WAY TO GRASP TO 
TAKE THE SWORD FROM THE ENEMY,
and strike him with the Pommel of it in the face.

[39] (P140.S2)
You must take the sword under the hilt of the enemy's sword, and at that very moment with your left arm take it away from the enemy's sword, and place your left hand on the fittings of the enemy's sword, turning your arm to the enemy's sword under the left side as you see in the figure, and at that very moment strike him with the pommel in the face, and immediately while holding the enemy's sword firmly with your arm, turn your waist to the right side, for by force he must release the sword, or his hand will break, because the strength of turning the waist is very great, and therefore if your enemy had twice the strength of you, you would take the sword from his hand.

[40] (P140.S3)
These four types of grips are only useful to those who have practiced them well; do not think that someone who has played for a month or two will be able to execute these grips, for they will not succeed, and then they would say that they are not good.

[41] (P141.S0)
[ 80 ] PROEM TO SIG.

[42] (P141.S1)
READERS.

[43] (P141.S2)
In this second Book, I do not wish to address the knife strikes that can be made with the sword alone, but you may serve yourself with the knife strikes described in the sword and dagger, such as how to parry a knife strike that comes to the head with the sword, and to strike in reverse to the head, or indeed to the leg.

[44] (P141.S3)
Still to parry a reverse strike to the head, and to strike with a forehand to the leg, or indeed to the head.

[45] (P141.S4)
You can still parry these knife thrusts by shifting your body, allowing the thrust to pass by, and then striking with the point or with the edge, as described in the Lessons of the sword and dagger.

[46] (P141.S6)
One stands in a guard, with the sword held high, as if to deliver a thrust, and while the opponent thrusts, one must deliver a thrust onto the sword, for thus one will parry his thrust; and it is necessary to immediately thrust to the head, or indeed to the legs, and to step back out of measure. And for as many thrusts as the opponent delivers, one must make it a point to parry strongly, and then thrust, for in this way he will not be able to offend.

[47] (P141.S7)
With resolute points, I wish to teach you how to deliver a thrust, a forehand, and a backhand.

[48] (P141.S9)
If your enemy stands in guard to await you, go to close in where he is exposed, as long as you are within measure, and deliver a thrust, turning the knot of your hand from where the enemy's sword is to secure yourself. And if your enemy parries your point, and you thrust from the right, or from the reverse, depending on your position, if you thrust from the inside, it results in a reverse, if you thrust from the outside, it results in a right.

[49] (P141.S10)
And it is necessary, all at once, to thrust the point, so that your enemy parries it, to execute the straight thrust, or the reverse thrust, according to your position, for in striking quickly, you will wound, and parry, and you will salute by stepping out of measure.
