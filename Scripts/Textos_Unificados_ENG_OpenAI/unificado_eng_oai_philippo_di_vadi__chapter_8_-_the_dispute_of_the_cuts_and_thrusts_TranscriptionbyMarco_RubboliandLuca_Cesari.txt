[1] (P20.S0)
[ 10r ] Â¶ Cost of cuts and thrusts.

[2] (P20.S1)
Chapter VIII.

[3] (P20.S2)
The route with the downward strikes and the flying ones speaks against the bridges and thus shows them that they are not so perilous.

[4] (P20.S3)
And when they come into our presence, All the strikes make them lose their way, Losing indeed the steel for that joust.

[5] (P20.S4)
Do not lose the strike of the sword: The point is of little value to one who turns quickly. Let the blows be wide as long as they go.

[6] (P20.S5)
If you do not have a free memory, If the point does not strike, you lose the engagement. All the other strikes there heed you.

[7] (P20.S6)
Against a single sun, the point finds its pact, And against more, it no longer fulfills its duty: This requires the document and the act.

[8] (P20.S7)
If the point thrusts and does not fear, If it suddenly does not take the good cut, It remains without fruit in my opinion.

[9] (P20.S8)
Here it is: 

"Here it is that I ask you to place your mind a little, if the thrust does not quickly exit, it makes you the companion of the painful strike."

[10] (P20.S9)
When striking, your sword is lost  
If it thrusts, it loses its way  
In the straight cross below, it aids you.

[11] (P20.S10)
A downward strike with the sword and a thrust from such a guard, so that you may find yourself in a bad position.

[12] (P20.S11)
Do not waste time learning for an hour; the great times with a serene hand place you above others and thus honor you.

[13] (P20.S12)
R Break every guard that is made earthly. Earthly guards await a small burden, and if the heavy ones pass, they do so without pain.

[14] (P20.S13)
The heavy armor does not quickly pass through the archway, The light one goes and comes like a breeze in the bow.
