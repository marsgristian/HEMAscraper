[1] (P203.S0)
[ 12a-d ] For this grip that I have, I can make a play with the dagger to strike and bind. And the quickest is to take the dagger in hand, so as not to receive from the companion any harm.

[2] (P204.S0)
[12a-e] If I turn the dagger towards your elbow, your dagger will be mine, I do not doubt it.

[3] (P205.S0)
[ 12b-c ] Of this my master, the first of his students, he takes the dagger, and this play can be done.

[4] (P206.S0)
In this way, I can dislocate your arm. Also, in the key below, I can bind you.

[5] (P207.S0)
[ 12b-a ] If I can give measure to your arm, in the binding beneath the life shall be taken from you.

[6] (P208.S0)
[ 12a-f ] Not letting go of the grip, I will pass under your arm, and I will make you stumble over your shoulders.

[7] (P209.S0)
[ 12b-d ] Although this play is not too commonly used, it is well done for those who have practiced it.
