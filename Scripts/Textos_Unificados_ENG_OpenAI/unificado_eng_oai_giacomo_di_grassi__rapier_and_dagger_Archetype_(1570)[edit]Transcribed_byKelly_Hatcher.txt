[ 36 ] OF THE SWORD AND DAGGER.

[2] (P85.S1)
And being that with as much brevity as possible I have come to the end of what can be discussed through the true science of the sword, it seems fitting to proceed from the simple to the composite, treating first of those weapons which, apart from the sword alone, are either more simple or less composite, and primarily of those which are most used today, and in which men practice the most, namely the sword accompanied by the dagger, which serves as an enhancement both in offense and in defense.

[3] (P86.S0)
Where it is to be noted that one can in these and similar arms practice that much desired and appreciated manner of fencing, which is said to parry and strike at the same time, a feat considered impossible with the single sword, although it is not so.

[4] (P86.S1)
Because there are certain strikes in the defense of which one offends, such as the straight cuts and high and low reverses, and of the high ones that are now silenced, in these weapons therefore, in order to be able to aid one another, one can with great ease defend and wound.

[5] (P87.S0)
Where it should be noted that these weapons are two and of lesser quantity one than the other, to each one should be given that part of defense and offense that it can bear; therefore, to the dagger, being short, should be given the entire left side to defend up to the knee.

[6] (P87.S1)
And to the sword, all the right side and the right and left together from the knee upwards, it should not seem strange that the dagger alone must defend against all blows from the left side; for easily the dagger withstands every great cutting blow when one wishes to meet the sword in the first and second parts.

[7] (P88.S0)
But one should not assure oneself of being able to withstand the sword with the mere dagger in the third and fourth parts, as they possess too great a strength and cannot be sustained by the mere dagger.

[8] (P88.S1)
Therefore, it often happens that someone attempts to defend against blows with both sword and dagger together, a method of defense that is now commonly used by all, believing that in this way they can better secure themselves, although this is not the case. For they place the sword and dagger in such a manner that they cannot strike unless they first disengage their weapons, thus consuming two times in which they could have been wounded when the one who strikes continues in a straight line without abandoning the thrust, seeing the enemy frantic to defend themselves. And if this has not been observed many times in practice, it is because they do not take advantage of this, or knowing it, they are not quick to execute, or they fear leaving.

[9] (P89.S0)
Thus, that method of defense will be to oppose a single weapon to the enemy's sword, keeping the other free to strike at will.

[10] (P90.S0)
And it is much to be noted that with the sole dagger, not only the blows of the sword but also of any other weapon, even the greatest, can be sustained and defended, when one ensures to meet them towards the hand.

[11] (P91.S0)
You should also know that with less danger one can deliver cutting blows with this weapon than with the sword alone, for although the point of the sword moves away from the straight line, it does not thereby leave the enemy free to strike, since there is another weapon prepared to defend against it, which does not occur with the sword alone, which, moving away to strike with a cut, presents itself and allows the enemy to reach first.

[12] (P91.S1)
I would not advise anyone, either in this or in any other kind of weapon, to practice striking with cuts; for under them, one can easily be wounded by thrusts.

[13] (P92.S0)
OF THE GUARD.

[14] (P92.S1)
In these arms, many guards are commonly placed; of which there are many that do not have reason, either because they are outside the straight line, or one can easily evade being wounded. All of these, being harmful, and not pertinent to our purpose, I shall leave aside, confining myself to those three alone with which one can easily attack and defend; all the others can easily be reduced to these three.

[15] (P93.S0)
OF THE WAY TO DEFEND WITH THE DAGGER.

[16] (P93.S1)
I have said elsewhere that the part of the person that must be defended by the dagger is the left side, that is; from the knee upwards.

[17] (P93.S2)
But the lower part together with the right should be entirely defended by the sword for greater convenience and safety.

[18] (P94.S0)
As for what one must do with the dagger, it should be noted that for great advantage, the dagger ought to be held forward with the arm extended, and with the point guarding against the enemy; which point, although it may be far from the offense, still serves to keep the enemy in mind.

[19] (P95.S0)
Whether one should hold the dagger with the edge or with the flat facing the enemy, this can be left to the judgment of the user according to what is more advantageous for them.

[20] (P95.S1)
He has seen some who hold the blade towards the enemy, claiming it to be to their advantage, that when encountering the sword coming with the edge, or thrust in the first and second parts, by stepping forward out of necessity while turning the hand, and placing the edge of the dagger where the face was before, in such a way that one can push the enemy's sword away from oneself without much effort, because every piece of motion in the first parts of the sword causes much variety at the tip, where the offense primarily comes from, in which case a wide dagger would be very useful.

[21] (P96.S0)
Others prefer to hold the dagger with the blade facing the enemy, using it not only for the defense of the dagger itself but also for the guard of the dagger with which they claim one can seize a sword. To facilitate this, they have their daggers, which, besides the ordinary blade, also possess two iron wings four fingers long, straight and distant from the dagger the thickness of a bowstring. At this distance, when it happens that the enemy's sword is thrust at them, they immediately turn their hand, gripping the sword and making a seizure of it. This may be considered clever, but I find it more imaginable than feasible, since in the heat of battle, where anger clashes with fear, one can hardly discern whether the sword is in the bind or not, and when one must still maneuver and maintain combat, the guided life is at stake.

[22] (P96.S1)
One must endeavor to do this by knowing accurately, and prudently discerning the movements of the enemy, the proximity and distance, and resolving to strike for the shortest path that leads to victory.

[23] (P97.S0)
Therefore, each one should hold the dagger with the edge or face towards the enemy, since with the dagger one can strike with the edge, which does not happen in any other way. But let it be held as one wishes; the arm should be kept extended, with the point as mentioned, in order to be able to find the sword very early, before it reaches the person.

[24] (P98.S0)
One must also have the infallible order that when a thrust or cut comes to the left side, it is necessary to draw it out with the dagger from the left side.

[25] (P98.S1)
And thus, by defending them with the sword, to drive them out from the right side, for otherwise, by pushing out from the left side with the right side, having the enemy's sword beyond the thrust of the transverse that is given to draw it out, the straight motion also reaches that which the enemy gives, continuing both, it may be that the straight motion reaches some part of the person before the transverse motion pushes it out.

[26] (P99.S0)
However, one should always draw out the strikes towards that part of life which is lesser, so that those blows coming from the right side may more swiftly escape from danger by being pushed away to the right.

[27] (P99.S1)
And those who come from the left shall likewise make it so that they exit from the left.

[28] (P100.S0)
However, one should always draw out the strikes toward that part of the life that is lesser, so that those strikes coming from the right side may more swiftly escape danger by being pushed away to the right.

[29] (P100.S1)
And those who will come from the left shall likewise make their exit from the left.

[30] (P101.S0)
[ 41 ] OF THE HIGH GUARD OF THE SWORD, & dagger.

[31] (P101.S1)
AND BEING this guard naturally first, as I have said, in the sole sword, it will be convenient to begin from this, which in this art can be formed in two ways, one with the right foot forward, which we shall call first, the other with the same foot back, which shall be called second, and this is to have the point of the sword farther from the enemy, it requires [42] more time, but the first, being closer, with the mere advancement of the foot forward, serves more quickly, but not with as much strength as the second, which, striking with the straight step, adds to the strength of the arm and the hand, also the strength of the whole body.

[32] (P102.S0)
Starting then from the first, as from that in which a man finds himself more easily, I say that one must in this, wishing to remain within the bounds of the true art, draw only the point with the advance of the front foot, stopping in the low guard.

[33] (P103.S0)
And in the second manner, which is formed with the right foot stepping back, and the sword held high with the dagger in front, maintaining it in the aforementioned way, in this likewise one must thrust solely with the tip with the greatest force that can be mustered with the extension of a straight step, also stopping in a low guard.

[34] (P103.S1)
One should not be assured in this weapon of striking with cuts to know how to have in hand a weapon for defense, for the same advantage is held by the one who defends, being able to protect with one weapon and strike with a stronger one, which is often defended with difficulty by the one who has already exerted all his strength, and can therefore deliver a cut, leaving him with little virtue to defend against a great encounter; thus, one should strive to strike with the point.

[35] (P104.S0)
Of all or the greater part of cuts, one will deal offense as well as defense, and will abundantly engage in deception.

[36] (P105.S0)
DEFENSE OF HIGH GUARD with sword and dagger.

[37] (P105.S1)
As a superfluous matter, I leave to say the manner with which one can evade the cuts, having already mentioned that with the thrusts one can evade all cuts.

[38] (P105.S2)
For the defense of one of the two sides, it is a great advantage to find oneself in a low guard with the right foot forward, which position will expose to the enemy the right side, where he will direct his thrusts, against which one can oppose in three ways, namely, either with the dagger alone, or with the sword alone, or with both together; however, in each of these, one must be careful to step obliquely, by which means one moves away from the straight line towards that part of the body which is to be struck.

[39] (P106.S0)
When one will defend with the sole dagger, one shall increase the step, the arm forward, and having found the sword, one shall strike with the increased step, straight from the low point prepared.

[40] (P107.S0)
If one defends with the sole sword, it is necessary, when making the step, to raise the sword obliquely, to carry it outward, or as one has found the enemy's sword, to strike with the dagger at the temple, stopping the sword with the sword, or instead of striking with the dagger, to use it to stop the enemy's sword, and with that, with the other foot stepping straight, to strike with the point, but it is very convenient to strike with the dagger.

[41] (P108.S0)
The third method after the oblique step, once the enemy's sword has been found, should be to stop it with the dagger, thereby causing the sword to strike with the point from below with the increase of the straight step.

[42] (P109.S0)
OFFENSE OF WIDE GUARD with sword and dagger.

[43] (P109.S1)
FOR a universal precept, I have given in every weapon and in every guard, that one should not seek to gain advantage or to strike the enemy more swiftly, by delivering cuts and thrusts that with ease, and with little danger, one can be wounded beneath the blows.

[44] (P109.S2)
These precepts, although they must be observed in every place and time, should never be neglected in this guard, for in it one cannot strike with a cut without great discomfort and a long duration of time.

[45] (P110.S0)
It remains, therefore, to use the point, which must be drawn with the advance of the front foot, having first, if possible, struck the point of the enemy's sword with the dagger.

[46] (P111.S0)
OF THE DEFENSE OF WIDE GUARD with sword and dagger.

[47] (P111.S1)
In this way, one can defend against the other thrusts in three manners: either with the dagger alone, or with the sword alone, or with both together. However, to defend oneself in any of these ways, it is most useful to assume a low guard. And when one parries with the dagger alone, one must increase the oblique step, and having found the enemy's sword, strike immediately with a thrust from below with the increased step, straight.

[48] (P112.S0)
And defending with the sword alone, which is the best of all other ways to wound the enemy and defend oneself, one must oppose the edge to the enemy's sword and thrust the point towards the face, also turning the back foot in a circle, to extend the point further and secure oneself better.

[49] (P113.S0)
With one weapon and the other together, it is possible to oppose the point.

[50] (P113.S1)
But this is such an inconvenient and rude manner that I, as it does not suit me, shall refrain from speaking of it.

[51] (P114.S0)
[ 45 ] OF THE OFFENSE OF LOW GUARD with sword and dagger.

[52] (P114.S1)
In all the guards, whenever one finds oneself with the point directed towards the enemy, it is a great disadvantage to strike with the edge. And if in any way it is permissible to strike with the edge, it is when the man finds himself in this low guard, because it is convenient and consumes little time to deliver some cuts between the thrusts. Moreover, by withdrawing, one can easily, and quickly, attempt to strike a cut from the knot, in which case it consumes little time and raises the point little from the straight line, making it difficult to enter and strike under these cuts. Indeed, it would be better not to use it, resolving instead to thrust more quickly after a thrust than to deliver a cut.

[53] (P115.S0)
This guard, as the high one, can be formed in two ways, namely with the right foot back; and this one with the right foot back is more suited for waiting for the enemy than for being the first to attack, because the offense in this position, although it is of great strength, is hindered by the sword being so far from the attack; which, before it reaches, consumes a great deal of time.

[54] (P115.S1)
It can easily be defended, either with a weapon or by retreating a step, but it is to be said of that alone with the right foot forward.

[55] (P115.S2)
In this, one can strike in two ways, being inside or outside; by inside, I mean when the sword encounters the sword, and the dagger of the enemy; and by outside when there is one of these in the midst of the other.

[56] (P116.S0)
Finding yourself thus within the reach of the enemy's sword, in which case the enemy's point comes to strike at the right side, you must with great swiftness increase your oblique step, and almost straight, to draw nearer to the enemy; and suddenly, by closing the enemy's sword between your own sword and dagger, and immediately halting, increase your straight step and thrust with the point.

[57] (P117.S0)
One can, in another way, and more simply, find oneself in the middle of the sword, striking if one can first, with the dagger the point against the enemy's sword outside of the straight line to that side which returns more conveniently, and at that time, by advancing the foot forward, thrust with great force a point to the face or chest.

[58] (P118.S0)
Finding oneself outside, one can, by advancing the foot forward, thrust a point at the face.

[59] (P118.S1)
Which almost necessarily comes to be defended from the enemy's sword, in which defense one must carry the sword with the point outside of the straight line; in this case, one can surely, by increasing the oblique step, quickly turn a reverse to the legs, and then immediately withdrawing the sword somewhat, thrust the point low with the increase of the straight step.

[60] (P119.S0)
One can, in the second manner, deliver a straight cut of a shorter knot, and as strong as possible, not so much for wounding the enemy's sword, which, being immediately encountered, must be met by raising the hand while stepping obliquely, and thrusting downward with the advancement of a straight step.

[61] (P120.S0)
In the third way, one can also strike by executing the aforementioned hand knot, and upon finding the enemy's sword, immediately increase the oblique step, and stop it with the dagger; then, swiftly drawing the sword, strike with a thrust from below using the straight step.

[62] (P121.S0)
And this shall suffice regarding what can be done with the sword and dagger, both within and without, in this guard, desiring only that which can be done through true art and rightly.

[63] (P122.S0)
[ 47 ] DEFENSE OF LOW GUARD of sword and dagger.

[64] (P122.S1)
The ANCHOR, which serves as a defense against the strikes of every guard, requires great consideration; in this, however, it is deemed much more excellent in judgment and readiness, for this guard opposes all the others, and most of the important strikes.

[65] (P123.S0)
More than in any other place, it stands and rests, and I believe for no other reason than to know that one can easily defend and offend in such a position, and because in this, as mentioned in the offense, it is more convenient to strike with the edge than in any other manner, although it has not been advised that it is good to use it; yet it can easily happen without putting forth some defense.

[66] (P123.S1)
Connecting before all other things that principle.

[67] (P123.S2)
He who is nearer arrives sooner.

[68] (P123.S3)
Knowing how much each blade can move, one should always resolve to thrust under the cuts, for by that thrust the falling of the cut is avoided;

[69] (P124.S0)
But because to do this they must be assured, or assured only quickly and with great heart; so that those may also remain satisfied who wish to parry all the strikes, and do in two times that which they could do in one, I shall therefore set forth the defense of the cut.

[70] (P125.S0)
Every time, therefore, that cutting strikes shall come, they will be direct or reversed, high or low.

[71] (P126.S0)
To the high thrust, one opposes either the dagger alone, or the sword and dagger together.

[72] (P126.S1)
When one is opposed by the dagger alone, one must advance straight, raising the hand from the dagger to meet the enemy's sword at its weakest point; and as soon as the dagger finds the enemy's sword, one should take a straight step forward and strike with the prepared low point.

[73] (P126.S2)
And if the sword and dagger are opposed together, the sword and dagger will remain together, and as the offense is encountered, one will cut the face with a reverse strike while pushing a point into the thigh of the enemy.

[74] (P127.S0)
the which point has this effect that it wounds beneath the edge in safety, and comes to be like an impediment and bar to the enemy's sword so that it cannot fall upon the legs, necessarily requiring in pushing it the foot from behind to turn to the right side.

[75] (P128.S0)
The Reverses will be either high or low; if they are made high, they can be defended against, either with the dagger alone, thrusting the low point with the rising, from the straight step after having found the enemy's sword with the dagger, or with the sword alone, stepping forward with the left foot, striking with a point already raised for the defense with the rising from the straight step of the right foot; and this method of defense is more in accordance with the art, for it has been said that all strikes coming from the left side should be defended against with the dagger, and those from the right with the sword alone.

[76] (P129.S0)
The low reverse shall be defended by pushing with a point with which one safely strikes and puts an impediment, and bars that the enemy's sword does not fall upon the legs.

[77] (P129.S1)
In other ways, this can still be repaired, all of which shall be called in the deception, for this is not the place for it.

[78] (P130.S0)
In parrying the thrusts, one must have the utmost caution in carrying the blade outside of the straight line, for this is the most secure way to defend against these thrusts that can be found, as it is difficult to counter these thrusts when they come in swiftly and with fury.

[79] (P130.S1)
Therefore, coming with the point from the inside, one must, at the moment the enemy wishes to strike, take a diagonal step, securing oneself with the dagger against the enemy's sword, and then thrusting with the point as one advances with the straight step.

[80] (P131.S0)
The point of the outside in the first manner also defends itself, growing in the time that the enemy strikes with the point, with the increase of the straight step; and thus the other manners are also defended.

[81] (P132.S0)
And likewise, when the enemy attempts to strike with a thrust, one must be quick to disengage the thrust, increase the oblique step, and stab with the advancement of the straight step, before the enemy can resolve to make another blow after the thrust.

[82] (P132.S1)
And this shall suffice when employing the sword and the dagger with advantage, and truly.
