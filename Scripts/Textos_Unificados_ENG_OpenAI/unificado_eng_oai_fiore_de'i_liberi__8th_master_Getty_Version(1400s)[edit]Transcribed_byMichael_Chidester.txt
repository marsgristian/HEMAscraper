[1] (P198.S0)
[ 17r-c ] ¶ The eighth Master is I, and I engage with my dagger.

[2] (P198.S1)
And this play is good in arms and without arms.

[3] (P198.S2)
And my plays are placed some in front and some behind.

[4] (P198.S3)
The play that is before me, or the fourth play, is one that strikes the player in the hand with the point of his dagger; similarly, he could strike this one from below, as he strikes him from above.

[5] (P198.S4)
He could still take his hand in the joint with my weary hand, and with the right he could strike me well, as you will find before you the ninth student of the ninth Master, who strikes the player in the chest.

[6] (P198.S5)
I could still make  
The last play that I abandon where my dagger is.

[7] (P199.S0)
[ 17r-d ] ¶ I am the counter of the eighth play that is before me and of all his scholars. And if I extend my left hand to his elbow, I will force him, in such a way that I can strike him across.

[8] (P199.S1)
Still in that turning which I will make, I could throw his arm over his neck and strike him in many ways that can be done.

[9] (P201.S0)
[ 17v-a ] ¶ This is a guard, and it is a strong play in armor and without armor.

[10] (P201.S1)
And it is good for it is sudden to put one in a bind from below and a strong key that becomes the Sixth play of the Third Master who plays with the hand reversed, who keeps the player bound with his weary arm, his right.

[11] (P202.S0)
[ 17v-b ] ¶ This cover that I make in this manner with my arms crossed is good in armor and without armor.

[12] (P202.S1)
My play is to put this player in the lower bind, that is, the one called the strong key, in that which the student before me speaks of, that is, in the Sixth play of the third King that plays with the right hand in reverse.

[13] (P202.S2)
And this play is done similarly to the one that is done before me, although it is made in another way.

[14] (P202.S3)
And our opponent is to be considered as such!

[15] (P202.S4)
