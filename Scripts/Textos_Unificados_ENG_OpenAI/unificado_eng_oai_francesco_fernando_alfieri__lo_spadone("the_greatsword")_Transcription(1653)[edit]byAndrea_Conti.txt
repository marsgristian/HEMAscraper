I. It is a certain thing that among all the exercises and arts practiced by humanity, there is neither a more excellent, nor a more illustrious, nor a more useful art than that of the Military, since with this one defends the Kingdoms, expands the Religions, avenges injustices, and establishes the peace and happiness of the peoples.

[8] (P129.S3)
The ancient and famous Republics, which will always serve us as examples and as a stimulus to embark on the path that leads us to civil happiness, held in high regard dexterity and agility, considering blessed those who were stronger and faster than others, as judged in their solemnities. They showcased those gifts that they had received from Nature, and which were enhanced by art; these exercises have been common since the early centuries to the Italic Nation. The practice of the great sword shall be commended, for in it the foot becomes nimble, the waist becomes flexible, the hand gains strength, and the arms are loosened. If we look to its origin, and who was the first to put it into use to enhance it, Salustius states that it was during the reign of Ninus; then in Asia Cyrus, in Greece the Lacedaemonians and the Athenians, and it passed to the Romans, among whom there were public Academies where the youth were taught by professors. Thus, there is no doubt about the antiquity and marvelous effects of the great sword, and whoever wishes to wield it perfectly must practice the art, for otherwise it serves no purpose but to entangle and ensnare the hands, which does not happen to an experienced one, who, when facing the enemy, will have ready the strategies appropriate to the situation, and emboldened by virtue, will accompany it with vengeance.

[9] (P129.S4)
To those, therefore, who without further discourse understand this virtue, it will be an easy task to reach the perfection that is desired, provided they observe the lessons of the following Figures, which clearly possess those particularities that are difficult to express with words, and let this be the purpose of the present discourse on this art.

[10] (P130.S0)
[ xxiii ] OF THE ART CONCERNING THE USE OF THE GREAT SWORD.

[11] (P130.S1)
Chapter.

[12] (P130.S2)
II.

[13] (P130.S3)
In this art, both Theory and Practice are considered; Theory is the manner in which we must operate with weapons in hand against the enemy, and how one should walk with the feet, and carry the arms, and also know how to strike blows, which we learn in various and different ways, serving both to offend and to defend, such as delivering straight, reverse, round, and cutting strikes, rising blows, thrusts, disarms, creating openings, and wheels, spins, body changes, and delivering points and cuts in various and different manners, and how to carry, thrust, and turn from one side to the other while standing, advancing, and retreating, in many ways that the art teaches, and with this exercise and study, courage is increased to defend oneself from bloodthirsty, quarrelsome people, ready to commit injuries; and he who knows how to make good use of this artificial weapon of the Great Sword can go against any enemy weapon, for it is quite advantageous, and in every place, a man can defend himself thus in wide and narrow streets, as well as in squares and in the countryside, should he be attacked by enemies from the front and from behind.

[14] (P130.S4)
This Noble exercise is much frequented in my school by Italian Lords, Poles, Frenchmen, Germans, and other respectable individuals from various Nations, and they do so to acquire swiftness, to strengthen their bodies, to enhance agility, and to awaken the naturally dormant intellect; thus, every aspiring knight can avail himself of the excellence of the art in the defense of life and honor in times of need.

[15] (P130.S5)
As we show with the discourses and with the figures, which clearly teach.

[19] (P131.S3)
To the best of my ability, I have strived that in this small volume there be no matter that is not approved by experience, nor experience that is not accompanied by reason. Therefore, the studious Knight will see through the following figures the variety of stances, body positions, and footwork, and with the sword, and in their places, we shall discuss the nature of each, and the effects that may arise from them. The discourses will be such that one can easily understand when it is time to employ one reason or another, and with what advantage and manner one should go against the enemy, even though a man who possesses knowledge may act as he pleases; for finding himself in any way will bring about a good effect due to the understanding of the art, which is the master of all offenses and defenses. However, when wielding the sword in the proper manner, and according to the changes and occasions presented by the adversary, one must operate differently, for what is good for one place does not hold in another. Its blade is divided into two parts: the first, near the hand, is the strongest of all, with which one can defend and resist any very powerful blow; the second, which follows, is somewhat weaker, but in offense, it is the principal of all, not only in thrusting but also in cutting, such that this sword comes to be divided half in defense, half in offense. Its length should be as long as a proportionate man, neither too large nor too small. It must have two cutting edges and be very light, so that the practitioner of this art can deliver cuts and thrusts with greater speed and less fatigue. Furthermore, it should have a good grip to secure the hand, the principal instrument of operation according to the nature and rules of the art.

IV.

[23] (P132.S3)
The body should be carried well-disposed, and naturally without force, and straight with a cheerful face, so that after taking hold of the great sword, one can advance against the enemy, to gain some advantage, and free oneself without any danger of being wounded by the enemy.

[24] (P133.S0)
Wishing to move the Knight to go against the adversary, he must begin and carry his feet in an ordinary step, just as one walks, albeit with somewhat greater swiftness of motion, and shorter steps, never should he enlarge this step, except when the man is to make resistance against the enemy, when he comes to offend, thus alone, as accompanied, and immediately with swiftness, which is often the mother of fortune, closing the path so that he cannot advance to strike; Many hold the opinion that in combat one should aim at the eyes of the enemy, which I do not know on what basis they found, since I have never seen, nor heard, nor read that men are Basilisks; I say that we should aim at the part of the person that we intend to offend, and not otherwise at the eyes; the observer of this art can go against every kind of honest weapon, and to resist against all the changes of the adversary, it is necessary to position the body and the sword in such a way that one is stronger than the enemy's weapon; therefore, it is essential to be rich in stratagems, to strike the enemy without stopping, as we shall explain in its places in the following figures.

[27] (P134.S2)
V. V Now I shall address the manner of wielding the Great Sword, which is a very useful weapon, keeping the enemy at bay, and is not subject to any prohibition; it is common in every Province, and permitted by every Prince. Many carry it as they please, and without rule: but because there are various ways, among which we shall show only one as the best, in which the movement of the feet, the motion of the step, and the disposition of the body are considered.

[28] (P134.S3)
Now wishing to carry it without boredom, nor any hindrance, both by night and by day, whether alone or accompanied by friends.

[29] (P135.S0)
The Great Sword should be taken with the right hand as the more noble grip, and with it, it will be carried in the left hand, and with this, it will be grasped, resting it against the same arm, as the present figure teaches. [06] Standing in this posture, the Knight can continue his journey, and when assailed one-on-one, or by many, he can swiftly, without further delay, grasp and draw the Great Sword with his right hand, and make use of it as the occasion demands.

[33] (P136.S3)
In this discourse, it will be shown that figures teach much more effectively than speeches, for seeing the postures and manners drawn, which must be observed to imitate them, removes all doubts that could arise from the weakness of the oppressive.

[34] (P136.S4)
The following figure represents, as one should, in an indivisible time to pause in the posture, and to remain free in order to be able to wait, and to attack according to one's pleasure.

[35] (P137.S0)
Wishing the Knight to make the first lesson, he must begin with the two main cuts, which are a downward strike and an upward strike, and they are delivered, and together accompanied by the right hand, and the left hand, stepping forward, and the body, delivering the blows, either low or high, according to the position, and the time; these two cuts are delivered indifferently, and repeated many times. The downward strike is delivered from the right side, and the upward strike from the left hand, and he who will proceed well, examining and reasoning with the intellect, will easily find the reasons to counter every one, as we shall reason in one place of one, and now in another of the following lesson.

[39] (P138.S3)
In this reading, the three cuts are worthy of observation, both for the subtlety of the strikes and for the mastery required in judging the effect of the present Figure, with which the passage begins. To achieve that honor which is desired, the body must be somewhat bent and prepared for strength; the arms should be united, and with both hands firmly grasping the Great Sword, moving with a natural yet generous step will simultaneously form the first cut from the right and the second from the left. These cuts are repeated several times, turning the body and the Great Sword with the hands around the head, and thus one continues in this manner, both in advancing and in retreating, as is more effectively demonstrated by the posture.

The present Figure will serve to awaken the memory in case, due to the length of time and little use, my recollections of spoken words have slipped from your mind.

[44] (P139.S4)
Now I will show you all the lessons, which are so ordered that one is linked to the other; Here we learn how to perform the three cuts, making the head guard with the great sword, and this not only serves to demonstrate the disposition and skill of the one who practices it, but it may happen that one must practice it in combat; thus, the arm will be held extended, and a series of three forehand cuts will be made above the head, and similarly with the backhand cuts, which must be thrust immediately forward without losing time. The hands will be turned together in second, as seen from the demonstration of the drawing, and with the union of the right and left foot, the strikes are extended, both forward and backward, always paying attention to the correctness of the step, to avoid the faults that diminish the merit.

[ 14 ] HOW TO MAKE THE THREE CROSSES OF THE GREAT SWORD IN A SPACIOUS PLACE.

[46] (P140.S1)
Chapter.

[47] (P140.S2)
IX.

[48] (P140.S3)
The present lessons are all taken from true occasions of the questions that most often arise in heated blood, we have come to the method of making the three crosses, to be used in times when one might be attacked by more people in the squares or in spacious streets, and to do this requires much judgment, accompanied by resolution and skill, as shown in the preceding figure.

[49] (P141.S0)
The first cross is divided with two cuts of the forehand, accompanying them with the right foot by turning the body and the sword around, and each strike makes its motion, keeping the left foot firmly on the ground, and the other, which moves with the cut twice, and then stops the right foot, and begins with the left foot together with two reverses, and once the two strikes are finished, one returns to begin again, as before, with the right foot, and will pass to the right side, executing the same two forehands, and once finished, the right foot stops, and the left is brought to the left side, and the two reverses are executed, and then one returns to the very place where one started.

[50] (P142.S0)
The second cross is made with three cuts from the right, and with three reverses; the rights are accompanied by the right foot, and the reverses with the left foot, turning the body three times, and with the Great Sword, while maintaining the aforementioned order.

[51] (P143.S0)
The third cross is made of four cuts, both forehand and backhand, repeated four times on each side, one in front, the other behind, and the same is done on the right and left flank, observing the rule that we have demonstrated with the aforementioned discourse.

[55] (P144.S3)
There are many ways by which one can resolutely advance without stopping against the enemy, and to do this it is necessary to have great judgment.

[56] (P144.S4)
In this place, we shall demonstrate the lesson of thrust and cut; the main movements are the forehands and backhands, with which above the head, the circles are formed and completed through the union of the body and feet, as seen in the proposed figure. It begins first with the forehand, and in the transition of the cut, the thrust accompanies it, extending forward with the step. The same is done with the backhand, thus from one side and the other, repeating the transition with cuts and thrusts together. According to the position and the occasion, a new play will begin, allowing one to derive from the novelty that enjoyment and delight that those who appreciate the virtues feel.

[60] (P145.S3)
I fear I may be tedious in repeating the same things, and become obscure by omitting them; now, as we come to the practical act of what is discussed through the Figures, it will nonetheless bring great wonder that in the drawing one resembles the other. This does not constitute the art; although they are similar in the act of the postures, they are, however, different in showing their actions.

[61] (P145.S4)
The present Figure demonstrates a beautiful invention, of making the three crosses with the points, and cuts, and because each one can be understood briefly, I shall declare it.

[62] (P146.S0)
The first cross is made with two cuts and a thrust together; it begins with the left foot resting on the ground, starting with the right foot by striking from the forehand, and with that, one turns around, continuing until the two cuts are finished. Immediately, the thrust is chained by turning the sword behind the hips, and the blow is delivered forward united with the swiftness of the step. Thus, it should be done with the two reverses and the thrust together accompanied by the left foot; the same will be done from the right and left sides.

[63] (P147.S0)
The second cross consists of three cuts and a thrust in a circle, and one observes the circumstances of the foot and body, and of quickness as mentioned above. First, one executes three cuts and a thrust with the right foot, and upon finishing that, one begins with the left foot, performing the same. This will be done both in front and behind, and to the right and left side, divided into three times, which are executed with the right foot and with the left.

[64] (P148.S0)
The third cross is made with four cuts, and a thrust similarly in a circle; this is done from the front, and from behind, and to the right side, and the left, now with one foot steady, and the other turning, finished with the right one, that one stops, and the left one moves, and it continues until the end of the four mutations, always supposing that the timing and the step are proportionate, without which all effort is lost, and the merit, and nothing is gained but blame.

[68] (P149.S3)
All the lessons are arranged; here we must learn to perform the cross spinning, which not only serves to demonstrate the skill and dexterity of the fencer; one must therefore keep the arm extended, as shown in the following figure, and with three upward strikes, one walks forward, and with the spinning motion, one turns the sword and the body together, and returns to the same place; similar upward strikes are also made to the rear, and continued from the left side, and then from the right side, doubling them at will, and although all of this is quite clear in itself, nonetheless it would be difficult to practice without a master.

[72] (P150.S3)
To perform the lesson of the Spazza Campagna, after having executed several thrusts with the right and reverses, starting from the right side, one makes the rotations of three steps with a right turn, and with equal mastery returns to deliver the reverses to the left side, and multiple times one doubles according to the multitude of men. It is necessary to remain continuously in motion, turning the body, and the sword now in one place, now in another, as the Figure teaches. In encountering the enemy, we must govern ourselves according to the opportunity and the place, for in many ways one can guide the steps from one side to the other, placing oneself in a well-regulated stance, and one will not fail to be recognized as experienced in this noble exercise.

It is of great advantage the artifice, adding that it is a rule of the art to feint with the edge and to strike with the edge; the Figure needs no many words, it shows to give a reverse and strikes with the forehand, it makes an act of striking with the forehand and hits with the reverse; one can perform those steps in this lesson, which have been learned from the master, the man can advance and retreat while delivering strikes extended with the knot of the hand, and the strength of the arms, and with the steps well adjusted; the Feint is nothing other than deception, which in itself is odious; This deception, of which I speak, does not offend either Justice or Faith, but is a precept of the art to simply overcome the enemy, and it is called Feint.

In this Figure, one holds the arms gathered with the Great Sword to make the step, and the counter-step; the body is made to play from one side to the other, making three cuts from the right and three from the left, changing the feet in time with the cuts, carrying them around, and extending the strikes forward, striving with all judgment to take advantage of swiftness, without becoming disconcerted, and thus the adversary remains thwarted.

Dangers arise when they are least expected; boldness compels us to fight, but victory belongs to virtue, to defend oneself from misfortunes both in war and in peace; by turning the great sword towards the enemy, one will be in good guard to withstand every offense.

[85] (P153.S4)
For the clarity of this lesson, we demonstrate how to begin with the natural step, moving three steps to the right to attack the adversary, and with three forehand strikes, we advance, and three more times we go to the left with three backhand strikes, troubling the enemy in a circle to gain some advantage over him. After having made several passes, both forehand and backhand, as needed; and beyond this, many caprices can be executed, turns, half-turns, and other artifices, which are the proper ornaments of the art.

[89] (P154.S3)
The following figure teaches the passage of the lesson, to the snake, beginning with the forehand and ending with the forehand, with five steps; the same is followed with the backhand, and ends with the backhand. The forehands are executed with the right foot, the backhands with the left foot, and this will be repeated several times according to the occasion. A man can defend himself from many people, whether in a narrow street or in a wide street, and by merely extending the arm and bending the body, he can reach the opponent. But the movements must be extremely swift, both of body, sword, and feet, for without any doubt this is the most secure and certain rule, that in the trial of such esteem, in which life is at stake, any person can defend themselves in every place.

[93] (P155.S3)
We have come to the manner in which the Molinelli should be formed with the upward strikes and downward strikes; there is no guard or strike from fencing that does not adapt to the art of the great sword; wishing to do this, which is my intention to teach in the present Figure, the Scholar must find himself in the passage of the right side or the left, and with upward or downward strikes turn the great sword and make the simple Molinello, always walking forward following the adversary, and retreating if one finds oneself pressed by enemies.

[94] (P155.S4)
In the double Molinello, one moves with the same rule, but more often the body turns, accompanied by the same rising and underhand strikes, both in advancing and retreating; and I firmly believe that it is a great advantage to attack.

[95] (P155.S5)
We leave long discourses to learned individuals, for our profession consists more in action than in words; in this way, with the great sword, one can go against a polearm, or spear, or halberd, and overcome it, as I have demonstrated the effect in practical action many times at different times in the presence of Lords and great Princes.

[99] (P156.S3)
In the handling of the great sword, it seems that skill and agility prevail over strength; it is clearly understood in our Figure how to defend oneself upon a Bridge, both with the forehand and the backhand, beginning with the right foot, and then continuing with the left, turning the body, and the step three times around, walking forward, and returning backward, many times according to the occasion caused by the enemy, both from one side and the other of the Bridge, always accompanying the strikes with the arm, and with the foot, and with the artifice; there can also be interspersed some feints, and other changes, which serve as embellishments to the lessons, and to showcase the spirit of those who practice them.

[103] (P157.S3)
The Art consists in possessing all that which seeks the mastery of the Scholar in skillfully wielding the Great Sword against another who bears the same weapon; against the other, one must employ the observation of measure, and time, and also investigate the nature and quality of the enemy's play, and from this observation, for the most part, depends the loss and the victory.

[104] (P157.S4)
If a man wishes to begin the combat against another, he must first stand firm in the presence of the enemy, and according to his movements, move with determination, thus either backward or forward, or to the right side or left, and advance, both one and the other little by little; if one strikes from the right, defend from the right, and strike from the left, and if he strikes from the left, defend from the left, and strike from the right, and the same must be observed in the upward and underhand strikes, and thus it continues until one side or the other is satisfied.

[105] (P157.S5)
I shall not extend myself to repeat what I have said many times before; the main method is taught by the present Figure, leaving aside many others, which have been more for the stubbornness of knowledge than for instructing the youth.

One gathers the great sword, holding it in the left hand; as shown in the present Figure; the drawing made by a good engraver, if it were accompanied by anyone who delights in such exercises, my works would have more credit, and I would often be with less effort; Here are the brief lessons promised by me, here is the compendium that was mentioned by me at the beginning; I have not elaborated on the explanations, so as not to have to repeat the same thing many times, I confess my weakness, yet I will serve as a stimulus to another more understanding to find what I have not known, and to demonstrate it with that style, of which my intellect is not capable; it is a difficult thing to please in this disheartened century; whoever looks into my soul will find what they desire, and I know in the meantime that the wise man is always discreet.
