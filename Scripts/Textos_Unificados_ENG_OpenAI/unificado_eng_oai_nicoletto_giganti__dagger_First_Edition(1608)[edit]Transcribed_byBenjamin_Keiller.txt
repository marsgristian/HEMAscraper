[ 102 ] PREFACE TO SIG.

[2] (P149.S2)
I cannot imagine the reason why the play of the dagger alone is not in use today.

[3] (P149.S3)
Perhaps this happens because of Masters who do not know how to teach it, or truly, because they do not want to teach it, or it may happen due to the negligence of men, who, ignorant of how important it is to play with the dagger alone, neglect to learn.

[4] (P149.S4)
I am of the opinion that it is as necessary for a gentleman to know how to wield a dagger alone as it is for him to master every other kind of weapon, and the reason is this: that the majority of great men and captains have been killed by a dagger or by other weapons similar to the dagger.

[5] (P149.S5)
Furthermore, in the lands where it is permitted to carry the dagger, if a gentleman comes to words with any of his enemies, who has another dagger, if he does not know how to defend himself, and is wounded with a dagger, he will be in great danger, as will his adversary.

[6] (P149.S6)
Furthermore, if an enemy of yours were to come to kill you with a dagger, and you found yourself without one, how can you save yourself if you do not know how to defend yourself against a dagger?

[7] (P149.S7)
Therefore, I urge every gentleman to seek to learn the art of the dagger alone.

[8] (P149.S9)
This other year, pleasing to God, I will send a particular Book of the dagger alone, against many kinds of Arms, which will be very useful to every sort of person.

[9] (P150.S0)
[ 107 ] THE WAY TO STAND IN GUARD WITH THE DAGGER, AND HOW TO PARRY WITH IT.

[10] (P150.S1)
After you have drawn your hand, you hold it as you see in the figures, that is, in front of the guard of the opposing dagger.

[11] (P150.S2)
But beware, that one should never strike with a dagger unless one has first acquired the enemy's dagger, as you see in these three figures.

[12] (P150.S3)
The first stands in guard.

[13] (P150.S5)
The third, how one strikes, as you will understand.

[14] (P150.S6)
When you have the dagger in hand, and you see your enemy exposed in some part, you must not strike, unless you have first gained the enemy's dagger; for you would both give yourselves, as each one would wish to make his blow.

[15] (P150.S7)
To gain the dagger, do it in this manner: as you are in guard with your dagger before you, and the enemy thrusts at you, either in the face or in the chest, you will parry with the edge of your dagger, and immediately thrust strongly with your own weapons against his. Thrust strongly, for you will give him a thrust in the face if he does not thrust strongly himself, and if he does thrust strongly, you can place your left hand on the hilt of his dagger, as you see in the third figure, for he cannot do otherwise, as you have thrust against his weapons, with weapons, so that he does not touch you with a thrust in the face.

[16] (P151.S0)
[ 109 ] A WAY TO SECURELY PARRY A DAGGER, AGAINST A DAGGER.

[17] (P151.S1)
In another way, this present figure teaches you to securely defend against a dagger, against a dagger, and it is done in this manner.

[18] (P151.S3)
But if your enemy finds himself with an unarmed hand, without a doubt you will cut off his hand, and you will throw the dagger to the ground, and without drawing it into your hand, you will be able in this manner to safely parry as many thrusts as your enemy can deliver, countering them while he thrusts with the point of the dagger, and immediately thrusting to the face, and returning out of measure as usual.

[19] (P152.S0)
[ 112 ] THE WAY TO PARRY WITH A 
DAGGER ALONE, AGAINST SWORD AND DAGGER.

[20] (P152.S2)
Now to know how to defend yourself, I have made this figure, that if your enemy were to assault you, you should draw your dagger, and if he were to thrust at you with the point or with the edge, parry with your dagger, retreating a little back, feigning to be afraid, so that he comes forward with greater boldness, and thus he will be disconcerted. For if you were to stand firm to await him, and to go under him, it would not succeed, for he would remain on guard, keeping you at a distance as long as the sword is, and he would not strike unless he saw a chance to hit you. But by parrying and feigning to be afraid, as I have said, he would follow you with thrusts and stabs, for being at such an advantage in arms, he would come resolute, thinking you to be of no power. Then you, having parried four or six thrusts, put yourself in guard, as you see in the figure, exposing your right side, and while your enemy strikes you resolutely and disconcerted, parry with the dagger, turning your body to the left side, and step with your foot, and place your hand on the hilt of the sword, so that your enemy cannot wound you either with the sword or with the dagger; from which you will be able to deliver as many stabs as you wish.

[21] (P152.S3)
It all depends on knowing how to take the time to pass, and to give the enemy the opportunity to strike resolutely, and the stronger he strikes, the worse it is for him.

[22] (P153.S0)
[ 116 ] THE WAY TO DEFEND WITH THE DAGGER ALONE.

[23] (P153.S2)
I declare that these things, which I write, are learned in times of necessity, and to perform these actions, one must be bold of heart, fearing nothing from the enemy, for if you lose your spirit, they will not succeed.

[24] (P153.S3)
These things serve for those who know how to play with the sword, and dagger, and other sorts of weapons, and who are skilled, and know how to recognize the time, and the measure, and when it is time to advance.
