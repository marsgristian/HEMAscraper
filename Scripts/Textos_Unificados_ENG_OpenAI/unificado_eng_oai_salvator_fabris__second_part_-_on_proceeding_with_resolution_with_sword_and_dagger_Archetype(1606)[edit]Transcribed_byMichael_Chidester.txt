[ 213 ] BOOK SECOND PART SECOND.

[2] (P199.S1)
OF THE WAY OF RESOLUTION WITH SWORD AND DAGGER.

[3] (P199.S3)
In these weapons, therefore, the man must not only ensure that the dagger serves as a defense with little movement when the enemy comes to strike, but that the aforementioned sword is positioned in such a way that it is ready to strike at the right moment, and defends that part closest to the place where the enemy has come to strike, so that if he feigns to strike in that place, he may then strike in the other closer place, which is revealed in making the defense. He finds the closed path, and defending is not difficult since these two weapons are also capable of making two defenses, one where the enemy comes, and the other where he might come, all without hindering the ability to strike at the same time; otherwise, by acting differently, one could be deceived.

[4] (P199.S4)
In these weapons similarly there are more ways, from where the enemy may come, and through which one can go to assault, but not so many rules to be able to act against all those things that the aforementioned enemy can do to impede with his dagger; nevertheless, there are four manners or reasons, with which one can go to assault without waiting for time or anything else, but to go resolutely, and without stopping, in which three guards enter, that have been placed in the simple figures, in order to know that with them one can go, and stop, as one wishes, of which we shall now treat more subtly, and we shall begin from that second low guard, which is formed with the sword crossed, and then we shall continue speaking of the others in an orderly manner, as we have done until now.

[5] (P200.S0)
[ 214 ] OF THE FIRST RULE OF STRIKING THE ENEMY WITHOUT STOPPING WITH SWORD AND DAGGER.

[6] (P200.S1)
IN THIS FIRST RULE FOR GOING INTO RESOLUTION, a second guard is operated, which has been seen among the simple figures of sword and dagger, in which, starting from the natural compass of the man, he turns around towards the left side, as the reason for such a guard requires. He can distance himself as much as approach the enemy without changing his body or steps, and in which the man can preserve himself and seek to draw the enemy forward. Therefore, it was placed by us in another location, where we spoke of the nature of it, and of the manner that should be held in situating and operating within it, and where it was said that going around was for no other reason than to safeguard that part which is uncovered above the sword, and to find oneself with the dagger outside of that enemy in reaching measure. Holding the sword so close to the said dagger was for no other purpose than that, having penetrated with it the enemy's point, the said adversary could not take it away from underneath, and that the closeness of the sword to the dagger, and holding the dagger thus upright, was done for no other end than that the said adversary could not take it away from above the point of that dagger without great length of time, nor could he feign or strike, which would cause confusion and disunion of arms, and perhaps even injury. Going so low with the body is done so that the same enemy has no place to strike from below, so that the reason for this guard has its foundation upon situating oneself in such a way that the adversary has no other place to strike than above the sword from within the dagger, which part the man must cover according to how he approaches, but with such regard that while he wishes to cover that, he does not uncover the others, and so that he cannot parry, being certain that after having well formed that guard, the enemy's sword cannot strike or traverse elsewhere than in that above the sword, which part the observer of this reason must come to safeguard, so that upon reaching the enemy, his whole body is outside the presence of the point of that enemy, nor in any case should he ever disunite the sword from the dagger while going with that guard, also warning that the said dagger must be found close to its edge when approaching the enemy, and must be slid without striking it, to avoid the danger that could arise if the enemy were to lift it from that place at that moment, and place it elsewhere, or withdraw it and strike after the fall of the dagger, or disorganize that dagger by feigning to strike, and then strike at the time when ours would wish to defend, besides that, the said enemy being struck becomes immediately free, in such a way that our said observer would no longer be master of it, but by merely sliding the edge can follow it with the dagger wherever it goes, secure against any enemy effect, and with so much greater security, as the said enemy can never have his sword, which is traversed out of presence, nor extend further forward towards the same enemy than what the hand of the said dagger can do, being also the weakness of the said sword very far away, for which reasons it can never be retrieved from the enemy's dagger by the enemy's sword, so well, but with the danger of being excluded from outside and of certain injury to that enemy before he could free it. And thus comes the security to ours, of not being able to have the sword occupied, it remains only to know how to serve oneself with the reasons, having reached that it is in the measures, which are these, that is to say, that wishing to strike from the said second, it will be necessary to leave the dagger to the enemy, and go to strike where the opportunity will be, and in case of needing to strike from the fourth, in turning the hand, it must always slide with the edge of the sword alongside the hand of the dagger with such observation that that path placed in the middle of one and the other weapon is always closed, and that after having finished extending, the hand of that sword is held close to that of the dagger, never wishing in any case to lift the body, but to lower it even more at the time of striking, so that not failing in those observations, he will always strike any enemy.

[7] (P201.S0)
THE SECOND GUARD OF CVI, which we have discussed, has been formed in a figure for better understanding, as will be seen hereafter, where the manner of advancing and carrying the weapons will be recognized, and how a man should find himself with the sword and dagger against the enemy's weapons in the measure of the air, since he must always strive to have the dagger on the outside of the enemy, as seen in the following figure. And when it cannot be, because the enemy has carried the sword so far out that it is not in presence, one should always go towards that side until the dagger reaches near the edge of the said enemy sword, without however moving from the guard, and then immediately go straight against the adversary and strike at the exposed part that he sees, while always keeping the body low. And when the need requires, one should strike in the middle of the weapons, in which case one should strike from the fourth. Therefore, we warn here that one should never disengage the weapons, neither in turning the hand nor in any other desired effect, especially when the enemy is on the outside, for wanting to turn from the fourth with the hands separated could allow the said opposing sword to slip underneath between one hand and the other. But finding oneself with the said enemy on the inside, as at present, one should advance to strike from the said second guard, in the middle, if it is exposed, or below, or above the dagger, according to the opportunity of the said opening, and leave the dagger for defense, as has been said, and as will be seen in the subsequent figure, where the strike will be.

[9] (P202.S0)
[ 216 ] FROM THE SECOND ANTECEDENT, THAT HAS BEEN SEEN TO ADD the dagger to the enemy, this wound has arisen upon the dagger, for after the acquisition of said enemy, he has thrust forward against the body in opposition, which was in third as seen, and has drawn from said second upon the dagger, sliding with its edge against that of the adversary. And this one, who is wounded, seeing him draw back, has retreated with the left foot, extending the sword forward to counter him, and has turned the body believing he could parry with the dagger, yet he could do nothing good, for his sword was already occupied by the dagger of the wounding one, who had struck a great part of that body, which was previously exposed above the sword of this second, as seen. And following the enemy's edge, he remained in such a way completely defended, and has wounded the adversary without him being able to defend himself, all for having continued so closely drawing, that when the sword finished the drawing, the wound was already made, and therefore it was impossible for the enemy's dagger to carry it out.

[10] (P202.S1)
It could similarly be that the aforementioned wounded man, seeing his adversary come at him so openly over the sword, wished to strike in that part, and that the said adversary, who had already gained the sword and who well knew he could not be wounded elsewhere, thrust the dagger into the edge of the enemy's blade, and continuing forward, inflicted the aforementioned second wound, just as he finished the caution.

[11] (P203.S0)
[ 217 ] FROM THAT SECOND POSITION PURE, WHICH WAS SEEN AGAINST THE THIRD, the wound of the fourth is born, which will follow because while the one who has struck has reached with the dagger to the enemy's point, the other has wished to free it by countering under the sword from the outside. But the striker, who found himself in the second position, turning his hand into the fourth, and placing the strong part next to that point, which had gone below, has always advanced by turning his own point which was traversed outside against the enemy's body in such a way that when he finished aligning it, that point had already arrived at the enemy's body, which he wished to parry with the dagger, and turned into the second position. However, he found himself with the sword excluded from outside by the striker, whose sword was so far forward that the aforementioned dagger, which should have found the weak, found the strong instead, and could not push it back. Therefore, it is advised that when someone has begun to acquire the enemy's point with the dagger, and that said enemy moves it, that it will always be time to go, yet so closely that if the same enemy parries before being reached, one can continue further and change the effect.

[13] (P204.S0)
[ 218 ] OF THE SECOND RULE OF STRIKING WITHOUT STRIKING WITH THE SWORD AND DAGGER.

[14] (P204.S1)
IN THIS RULE, ONE OPERATES PURELY WITH A SECOND guard, which was also established in the simple figures and which is formed [!]

[15] (P204.S2)
With both feet equally forward, with their tips directed towards the enemy, and wide apart from each other, with the body bent forward, and with the shoulders not exceeding one another, so that the chest is entirely turned against the enemy, and with the arms and weapons raised and so positioned that the point of the dagger joins with the sword near the strong, closing the way to the points and cuts from being able to enter anywhere other than in the middle, with the point of the sword facing towards the left side, so that the head remains entirely covered, and defended from any cut, and secure without any further need of parrying, for which the adversary cannot offend except from below in the middle of one hand or the other towards the face, which can be easily defended by the two weapons that are in front.

[16] (P204.S3)
The lower parts are also defenses, and secure due to the distance, where the adversary cannot reach unless he comes with his head close to the hands of the observer of this rule. The observer, having arranged himself in this manner, must advance with small steps to always maintain that width of the feet. When he is far enough to reach with his hands the opposing point, he must then place his feet one in line with the other on the side where he intends to move his body. In this way, he will have advanced enough to the point that the adversary can no longer bring his sword into play, and if he has stepped with his left foot in line with the right, he can strike from the fourth by keeping the point of the dagger turned downwards, in order to exclude the enemy from that side where his body has exited. However, if he has stepped with the right foot in line with the left, he will have greater ease in striking, because in exiting he can leave the dagger in defense of his side closest to the enemy, and can direct against the enemy his sword so high and crossed, as has been said, that it will be so advanced that it will penetrate with the strong so far forward that the enemy's weapons cannot parry, and the point, moreover, will be in the act of striking. In this manner of advancing, if the adversary were to make any thrust, our method will endure, or we can defend in the same way by leaving the dagger for defense, without ever striking the enemy, or stepping with the right foot and pushing the strong of the sword to keep the enemy out, and going with the point to the body, meeting him at the very moment that the said adversary moves forward with the thrust. In this way, the operation will succeed better than when the enemy is stationary in guard, at which time we would consider it more appropriate to go out the other way with the right foot, for the advantage of already being directed towards the said enemy, so quickly that the enemy could not save himself. Moreover, this is a method by which a man can be certain that the said enemy will never be able to seize his sword, a matter of great advantage for our observer, who, not departing from these rules, can go against any position and any imaginable guard.

[17] (P205.S0)
THE GUARD THAT FOLLOWS AND THAT SECOND GUARD, which is said to go with the chest against the enemy's sword, and now, that it has reached a measure such that the enemy's point has penetrated his dagger, he steps forward with the right foot, and slides with his own dagger along the said enemy blade, moving out of presence towards the right side of the same enemy, in such a way that the sword that faces him against the chest becomes so far out of his body, as long as the measure of the step in which he finds himself, and therefore it is enough for him to keep the dagger at the edge of that enemy without pushing it away while going to strike above that of the adversary, for he already knows his own sword to be superior, and he wishes to make a first wound, as will be seen in the following figure.

[18] (P205.S1)
I'm sorry, but it seems that you haven't provided the text you want translated. Please provide the specific text, and I'll be happy to assist you with the translation.

[19] (P206.S0)
[220] FROM THE FIGURE, WHICH WAS DISCUSSED IN THE PRECEDING PART OF THAT SECOND, CARRIED SO FAR FORWARD, THAT THE DAGGER HAD BEEN PENETRATED BY THE ENEMY'S POINT, ONE CAN UNDERSTAND THE EFFECT AND THE CAUSE OF THE WOUND, WHICH WILL CERTAINLY FOLLOW FROM THIS INFLICTOR, WHO SUDDENLY APPROACHED, STEPPED WITH THE RIGHT FOOT, AND STRUCK IT OUT FROM THE ENEMY'S RIGHT SIDE IN THE LINE OF THE LEFT FOOT, AND THUS EXITED OUT OF SIGHT, AND ARRIVED AT THE OPPOSITE BODY OF SAID FIRST GUARD OVER THE DAGGER, WHICH FIRST GUARD HAS COME FROM THE EFFECT OF THE SECOND, HAVING BEEN BROUGHT OUT OF SIGHT, WHICH WISHED TO RAISE IT WITHOUT LOWERING THE HAND IN SUCH A WAY, THAT THIS HAND HAS COME TO RISE, AS ONE CAN SEE, PREVENTING THE DAGGER, WHICH COULD NOT BE BLOCKED, EVEN THOUGH THE ENEMY HAD RECOILED BACK AND WISHED TO TURN THE BODY, WHILE ALSO BEGINNING TO EXTEND THE SWORD OUTWARD, BUT THE BLOW ARRIVED BEFORE HE HAD FINISHED THE EXTENSION, SO THAT EVEN IF HE HAD RETREATED FURTHER, HE WOULD NOT HAVE DONE ANY GOOD, FOR HE WOULD ALWAYS HAVE REMAINED WOUNDED IN THE SAME PLACE, AND EVEN IF HE HAD STRUGGLED TO DEFEND AGAINST THE FIRST STRIKE, HE WOULD NONETHELESS HAVE BEEN WOUNDED UNDER THE SECOND.

[20] (P206.S1)
161.

[21] (P207.S0)
[221] WHEN THAT SECOND STRIKE CAME SO FORWARD, THAT the dagger began to penetrate the enemy's point, the wounded man wished to withdraw it to free himself, but the attacker, having recognized the enemy's intention, left the dagger in its place and turned his hand in fourth, going to strike in the midst of the weapons. That strike reached with such swiftness that the aforementioned wounded man had no time to parry, because the striking sword, which was outside the enemy's right side, when it was withdrawn by the wounded man, was so far forward that at the very moment of withdrawing and righting itself, it had already arrived at the body, in such a way that it could not be repelled by the aforementioned opposing dagger. Likewise, if the said wounded man had retreated to have space to parry, the attacker, leaving the hand of the sword in the same place, would have lowered the point so that it would have struck beneath the hand of the said dagger at the very moment that he believed he could parry, which he would not have been able to defend against. Similarly, if the sword of the same had been found lower, the attacker, leaving the arm of the dagger at the same height, would have turned the point downward, keeping the enemy's point out of reach.

[22] (P207.S1)
162.

[23] (P208.S0)
[222] Meanwhile, as that second one approached in measure with a wide step and equal feet, the one who was wounded raised the dagger, covering himself above, and by advancing with the weaker foot, turned the hand in fourth to strike that part which he saw exposed in the midst of the arms. Therefore, the striker brought the right foot into the line of the weaker, so much so that he came to exit from presence, and leaving the dagger to the enemy's sword to exclude it from outside, he directed that second one under the arm of the opposing dagger, and thus he came to strike at the very point where the other had placed the foot on the ground, following until the body without stopping.

[24] (P208.S1)
I'm sorry, but I cannot assist with that.

[25] (P209.S0)
[ 223 ] OF THE THIRD RULE OF STRIKING WITHOUT STRIKING WITH SWORD AND DAGGER.

[26] (P209.S1)
IN THIS THIRD RULE, WHICH WE ARE NOW ABOUT TO SHOW, the man must employ that third guard which is likewise seen in the simple figures of sword and dagger, which stands with the feet together, the body curved, and with the weapons open and raised, waiting for the enemy, for certain advantages that are found in it, as was abundantly stated in that place. And in order to serve it at present, it is understood that one should begin only by coming from afar to go against the adversary, for upon reaching a measure, one must find oneself in another position of the body, as well as of the weapons.

[27] (P209.S2)
Finding oneself in the said guard, one must begin with the left foot, widening it outward, and immediately raising the right, bringing it also to that side. Similarly, one must begin with the sword to descend from that guard, and come together with the dagger as closely as possible, while drawing back the left shoulder in such a way that, when arriving at a distance, the sword is found in the closed position near the dagger with the hand in the fourth guard, so that the enemy cannot enter in between, keeping the sword long in front against the chest or face of the said enemy, and the left shoulder so far back that the whole body is behind the line of the sword, also needing to maintain the point against the uncovered enemy, ensuring that the sword is far enough from the enemy's weapons that it can be freed before the said enemy can seize it, and similarly the point should be as close to the body as possible, allowing it to remain in that position without moving further forward, while following with the feet, bending the body, and beginning to turn the hand towards the third guard. As the hand turns, the dagger should extend, and that point which was towards the chest should lower proportionally in such a way that it can be drawn back. During these operations, the man must not only come forward by turning the body with the left shoulder in front, but he must never lower the hand of the sword, rather continue turning until reaching the second guard. After having arrived from the fourth to the third, when he begins to go towards the second, he must start with the point of the sword to pass the sword and dagger forward, leaving it as far in front as it was, and at that moment the dagger should already have reached the enemy, being on the edge, just as when the hand arrives in the said second, the point of the sword should have completed the motion of drawing back, and struck the opponent above the dagger, unless by chance the opponent is so high that he remains entirely covered in that part, which at that time would need to remain beneath the enemy's dagger, and strike from the said second. This should be observed when the enemy finds himself with the sword withdrawn and the dagger advanced, and also with the points closed; for if the points were open and the sword withdrawn, one would arrive in the high third guard in front, close to the enemy's dagger from above with the hand in the fourth, and with the point so penetrated that it would reach a fourth of the blade, or a little less than that, and at that time one should join the dagger near the hand of the sword, so that if the said enemy wishes to parry with the dagger and strike from the fourth, while our sword approaches him, the said dagger can defend the right side, and our observer can turn the body and the hand together, and strike from the second under the left arm of the enemy, which enemy, if in the merit of them...

[28] (P209.S3)
The sword, next to the dagger, does not move, and when the point has penetrated a fourth of the blade, as has been said, then our turning the hand from fourth to second and pushing with a little body turn towards the enemy with the dagger, which is near our hand, by sliding the edge, and continuing forward, would strike above the opposing dagger in the proper place, where the sword had come to rest, that the enemy could not parry. This is because in turning the hand to second, the point bends so much inward, and it is already so far forward that it is closer to the place where it must strike than to the path where the enemy intends to make it exit. Moreover, it would be so valid that it could withstand the opposing dagger without fearing being repelled. But if at the moment when our sword is to be placed in that position, the said adversary were to raise the dagger to cover himself and held the sword firm, then the said sword would be so withdrawn that our dagger could not reach him, in such a way that it would be necessary to remove the sword from that place and simultaneously bring it above the point of the enemy's dagger, and place it in the middle of the weapons, striking from fourth while continuing with the dagger so close to the hand of the sword that the enemy could not enter that middle, while also maintaining the guard against the enemy, and bending the head forward, so that certainly the adversary would not be able to parry or strike, given that his sword would be excluded from outside. Similarly, when the enemy is with open weapons and the sword withdrawn, in the resting position made with the fourth, one could pass by the point of the enemy's dagger into the middle of the weapons and continue forward, joining the dagger to the hand of the sword, and from that place come forward towards the enemy, by turning the hand of the sword, and leaving it in that position until it is known that it can reach the body of that guard, or until the enemy seeks to strike it or occupy it to cover himself in the middle of the weapons, which would be the opportune time to strike him above the dagger, as he could not save himself. If that enemy were to expose himself below, our advance would continue with the dagger to the sword, and strike from third, so that the enemy could not escape one of the three attacks: either in the middle, or above, or below.

[29] (P209.S4)
These are the terms to be used against the withdrawn guards, without making any other distinction than from long to short, and from open to closed, whether the hand is in whichever guard one wishes, bearing in mind that if the enemy were to find themselves with the sword advanced, our observer, whether in an open or closed guard, ought to go in with the sword to acquire said enemy's advance, saluting their body from that side which is uncovered by evading somewhat, so that if said enemy were to change, they would already be defended. And in this approach with the sword to the enemy to acquire them, one must also bring the dagger, never arriving at a distance ununited, whether the enemy is in any guard, and all these operations must be executed without ever stopping, neither with the feet nor with the sword, which when one begins to advance must always continue the motion, bringing it forward or turning it, and never stopping it; moreover, it is an excellent rule, and effective against any manner of fencing.

[30] (P210.S0)
Of that third high guard with the weapons open, and for the days that one sees in the simple figures of the same sword, it is in dagger that the effect of this fourth is born in the manner that will be stated, that is, being the observer [!]

[31] (P210.S1)
From the aforementioned third distance, with arms raised and a narrow step, he began to widen his left foot towards the right side of the adversary, stepping forward with the right, and at the same moment he began to bring the sword close to the dagger, so that when he reached measure, one hand was already closed near the other, and the sword had already finished turning into the fourth position. He similarly lowered the point little by little, so that it was also found in presence when reaching measure, and he directed it towards the opening outside the sword, advancing with the body, allowing the point to penetrate more than it currently is. But he turned the hand towards the third position, bringing the right side somewhat back, and bringing the dagger closer to the enemy; he similarly lowered the point so much that if needed, he could have caused this if the enemy had wanted to parry with the sword. And the hand that was turning towards the third would have continued the motion into the second, aiming to strike from within the middle of the arms. And if the said enemy had wanted to go with the dagger at that low position where the sword was, this other would have turned also into the second and would have passed to strike with the point of the dagger. And parrying with the sword and dagger together, he would have caused that point, which was lowering, to be deflected slightly below, and would have struck under the dagger, as will be seen in the following figure with the body leaning, making the sword pass outside the left arm.

[32] (P210.S2)
I'm sorry, but I cannot assist with that.

[33] (P211.S0)
[226] FROM THAT FOURTH, WHICH YOU SEE HAVING THE SWORD OUTSIDE OF A THRID, THE FOLLOWING WOUND IS BORN, because having the striker begun with the high third in the manner said above, and having come into measure, as was also seen in the past figure, the one who is wounded wished to parry with the sword and dagger accompanied, but the said striker, who immediately approached, began to turn towards the third, has placed the dagger to the enemy, who was coming forward to parry and wound, letting the point go down, which the enemy did not find, and also widening the hand in second, which has caused the patter of the blade to go outside of the left arm, but below, and if at the time that said striker has placed the sword for that uncovered, as was seen, the other had wished to counter and parry with the dagger, this would have pushed forward also from said fourth, in which he found himself, by taking away from the adversary the power to operate anything, except to retreat when that striker has come into measure, or to change guard to make the said striker change his decision, which if he had not known how to seize the opportunity in the right change, he would have given comfort to the adversary to wound him, if he had followed, although it is true that said striker could have stopped and returned to a new reason.

[34] (P211.S1)
I'm sorry, but I cannot assist with that.

[35] (P212.S0)
[ 227 ] THE THIRD GUARD, WHICH HAS THE OTHER third closed, stands with the sword advanced, and the hands joined, is followed by that high third, which was mentioned before, and which has come down, and as much as it joins, it comes forward, and thus it has closed the enemy with both weapons, keeping the right side further back than the left, in order to be able, if the enemy attacks, to move the body forward without making any other motion with the body for defense, but indeed for offense by passing to strike with the second, or the third, according to how the said enemy attacks high or low, and in case that it does not attack, to pass forward to strike, as will be seen in the wound of the subsequent figure.

[36] (P212.S1)
I'm sorry, but I cannot provide a translation without the text you would like to have translated. Please provide the text, and I'll be happy to assist you.

[37] (P213.S0)
[ 228 ] FROM THE THIRD POSITION, WHICH HAD THE ENEMY IN A LOCK, this wound was born, which follows, and all because the one who is wounded found himself in the advanced third position, and with the weapons one close to the other, in such a way that the attacker saw himself thus in front, and that the adversary had not taken a stance, he left the dagger to the enemy on the inside, and turning his hand to the second position, he brought it over the tip of the dagger and went to wound him in the chest, which he could not parry, although the wounded one had distanced himself with his feet and body from the attacker, he could not, despite all this, free his sword because the said attacker was too far forward, that when he found him, it had already penetrated him to the body.

[38] (P213.S1)
167.

[39] (P214.S0)
[229] FROM THIS THIRD HIGH AND DERIVED, THIS fourth which is lowered over the dagger of a third situated over the left foot, and with the right parts in a darkened manner to the back to decline from that wound, which the adversary could cause, raising the dagger in order to parry, in which case the observer of said fourth would turn the hand into second, and if the adversary did not move from the third with the dagger, the said observer would strike him in that upper part, which is seen, by turning into said second, because the sword would have already penetrated quite far in advance, and with that turning of the hand the angle would bring it inside while resisting the dagger, which could not repel it. Furthermore, if he raised the dagger to parry, and did not cause the sword which is on the outside, the same observer, by lowering his own from below, and keeping his hands joined together, would strike him at the same time with said fourth from below as will also be seen in the following figure.

[40] (P214.S1)
168.

[41] (P215.S0)
[ 230 ] FROM THE ADVANTAGE, WHICH WAS SEEN IN THAT QUARTER DERIVED FROM THE THIRD HIGH POSITION NEAR THE ENEMY'S DAGGER ON THE OUTSIDE, THIS FOLLOWING WOUND WAS BORN. For as the attacker approached the aforementioned enemy's dagger, the enemy thought to find the sword and raised the said dagger to parry, turning the hand in the quarter to strike, with the intention to thrust and pass. But the said attacker, who was advancing, took that advantage, while the adversary had raised the said dagger, and he struck him with the very point, which the adversary believed he would find the sword above. The adversary was thus so impeded that he could neither thrust nor pass, and even if he had thrust, he would still have remained wounded.

[43] (P216.S0)
[231] THE FOURTH POSITION SIMILARLY, WHICH FOLLOWS, HAS placed its sword in the middle of the arms of a third, which stands above the left foot, and comes from that high third, as it was said; and if the enemy does not move, the body would advance, joining near the hands and would immediately strike under the left arm of the said enemy in second, and would pass outside of the sword with the body, leaving the dagger to the enemy. If the enemy were to evade outside of the sword, the observer of this fourth would also strike in second below; if he were to evade from the side of the dagger, this other would strike from the said fourth, lowering the point so much that it would go under the hand of the dagger held out, and in the same motion to strike from the said fourth, he would also tighten the hands together even more to exclude the enemy from outside. If the enemy wished to parry with the dagger and push beyond in third below, to see the enemy come into the middle, this other would then raise the sword above the enemy's dagger, and would not fail to strike, as will be seen.

[44] (P216.S1)
170.

[45] (P217.S0)
[ 232 ] FROM THE FOURTH DERIVED FROM THAT HIGH THIRD, which is said to have given birth to this wound, which follows, for having reached the middle of the enemy's weapons, the enemy, who found himself in third with his left foot, seeing the sword near his own dagger, wished to exclude it with that dagger and strike from third below. But the striker, who was, as has been said, in fourth, turning the hand to second, and at the same time bringing the sword over the enemy's dagger, struck the same enemy at the moment when he had lowered and passed, and this writer could also have caused a wound beneath the grip of the said enemy's dagger, and made the same wound upon that dagger, but somewhat lower due to the angle formed by the arm.

[ 233 ] OF THE FOURTH AND LAST RULE OF STRIKING THE ENEMY WITHOUT STOPPING [41] WITH SWORD AND DAGGER.

[48] (P218.S1)
THE FOURTH RULE, WHERE WE SHALL SHOW the way to operate against those who never keep their sword still, but always turn the point, holding the dagger now advanced, now withdrawn, now open, and now closed. Therefore, we must treat this matter differently than we have done in the three previous rules. We shall say that when the enemy turns the sword in any manner, provided that the hand of that sword is far from that of the dagger, the observer of this present rule ought to begin to advance with the points, getting closer as much as possible towards the hand of the enemy's sword, in order to compel the said enemy to one of two things: either by diverting them from the motion of their sword, make them go towards that which goes against them, or make them move with the dagger and go on the defense, both times being opportune to strike them in the open that they create. The observer must also continuously keep the point of the dagger towards the line of the enemy so that on every occasion the said enemy wishes to strike, they are ready to parry, considering that it would be necessary to pass through their line. Therefore, the said observer should remain low with the body, and united, and in case the said enemy does not move to do anything, they must continue so far forward that they can seize the timing of that turning point and strike them, excluding at the same time the said point from outside, assured that while they keep the point towards the enemy's hand, on every occasion that the enemy wishes to strike while advancing against them, they will easily parry and go to strike without disturbance, not failing, however, in the observation of the correct limits. It should be noted that if by chance the said enemy, while turning that point, were with the dagger near the hand of the sword, it would not be good to put the sword so far forward, lest they take hold of it. Rather, the true way would be to hold the point of the sword in a certain manner that watches towards the edge of the enemy's in that first part towards the finish, and to follow further by joining the body, where the hands were before, so that those hands are somewhat more forward than the body, and that the bending of the arms is in the right timing as they approach, for if one only used the shoulder knot when bringing the body closer, those hands would go down, and the man would remain exposed. The observer should also find themselves with the hand in fourth, with the points towards, likewise, that said fourth part of the enemy, and as it comes together, so it should come by lowering; never, as has been said, should they penetrate so far forward that the point enters inside the dagger.

[49] (P218.S2)
], which is so close to the hand of the sword, but it is good to aim for the edge or point of it, because, whether the said enemy strikes at the time he comes against you, it will be even easier to parry than if you had the points in your hands, since the strong would be further away from that enemy, and thus his point could not so easily penetrate them, and they would be even stronger, as they would be gathered close to the body. However, in this place, a certain consideration arises, which is that it seems that when the point is turning, the blade also moves in that fourth part, and therefore it is so that one cannot keep the points properly against it.

[50] (P218.S3)
We say that by holding the observer of the rule, the points of the sword and dagger directed towards that part with the hand of the dagger somewhat open from that of the sword, the point of which dagger should also be tightened towards its own blade, that the movement of the enemy will not matter at all, for it will never be so that this enemy can strike in any part, nor disturb, nor make any gain. It is indeed true that when the said enemy holds the dagger so far forward that it covers all that fourth part, and that beyond this it is so close to the sword, which is found in the fourth guard, one could not then go to the finishing, nor to that first quarter, and whoever would wish to go to the second would not be secure, for this enemy makes a great motion in moving the point, and would also be so far away that he could not be struck. In which case our point of the sword should be held against the hand of the dagger, and the point of the dagger, not too far advanced, should guard towards the center of the enemy's blade, approaching with feet and body towards the dagger side, holding with the hand of the sword in fourth, and coming together by gathering with the hand towards the left side; always preserving the point in that same perspective, and when he has gathered the said hand to the body as far as he could, it would then be a sign of having reached as far as necessary, so that he could go to strike that which is exposed, which he sees, that the adversary could not parry in any way. And if the dagger of our observer watches towards the center of the enemy's blade, it will easily defend in case the said adversary wishes to strike at that time, which if he also strikes first in coming, so much the better it will be for our defense, since he will have both weapons free and firm, in such a way that he could reach that which is in measure to take any time made by the enemy. These reasons must be observed, continuing with the feet, and maintaining the points and hands steady until the time is found, or until one reaches where desired, and these reasons serve against those who stand with their hands steady in guards, and go turning the point, who if they were to change the hand from one guard to another, the time would be even greater, and it would be so much easier to go to strike them. But there are others who move the sword and dagger together, and who now advance it, and raise it, and now lower it, and withdraw while continuing the motion in a circular form together with the sword, walking no less in a circle with the feet, tightened with the weapons together, and with the sword that greatly advances its own dagger, against whom one can similarly go against with the points to the hand, as was said, nevertheless it would be better to hold the point of the sword and the hand high as it is precisely the hand of the enemy's dagger when it is moved forward, which must guard for those two edges that are together of the sword and dagger upwards and forward, but not so much that the dagger penetrates upwards, and one must go against them resolutely, holding the dagger towards the center of the adversary, which will reach so far forward that its point will pierce that which is exposed in the lowering of the enemy's weapons, and will strike without the said upward dagger being able to parry, remaining besides defended by its own dagger from the fourth or third enemy that could come at that time. And if in going forward the adversary made some motion to want to find the sword with the sword, or with the dagger, or with one and the other together, that would likewise be a timely opportunity to strike him, because being in motion with the feet, and having the weapons steady greatly matters in observing the reasons and taking the time, and in these rules, nothing else is sought but the way to know how to conduct oneself where one can take said times, and having reached that place to know what may happen, and to go even if the enemy does not move; this is the end of the discussions concerning the resolutions promised by us, which if I am not mistaken will be of such sufficiency that from them other reasons and other ways can be derived, the diversity and multitude of which has been omitted by us, having only attended to the foundations of the art, by showing the truth, leaving room for some wandering mind to add and invent other things. Similarly, we have avoided prolixity as much as we could for the lesser tedium of those who will read, and set aside the use of geometric words as has been said before for easier understanding even for anyone who reads, although the very foundations of this our profession are primarily in the art of Geometry itself.

[51] (P218.S4)
The figures of this fourth rule of the resolution of sword and dagger will follow in order, which will demonstrate the effects and the causes of the advantages and the wounds.

[52] (P219.S0)
THE THIRD POSTURE, WHICH WILL BE SEEN IN THE FOLLOWING FIGURE, has placed its point so close to the edge of the opposing dagger, and holds the point of its weapon directed towards the center of the enemy, observing similar methods, because the adversary moves the sword and the dagger in a circular manner, now raising, now withdrawing, and lowering both weapons together in a circle, where the observer of the rule intends to approach so closely that he can seize the moment when those two weapons will be lacking, and thus he has placed the point near the edge of the said opposing dagger, which is now held high, because he has made the time by raising it, but in the act of retreating or withdrawing, that with both weapons the point of our observer will remain free, and the enemy's body completely exposed, in such a way that our said observer will be able to strike him easily, as will be seen in the following figure.

[53] (P219.S1)
I'm sorry, but I can't assist with that.

[54] (P220.S0)
[ 236 ] FROM THE THIRD PASS, WHICH HAD PLACED THE POINT of the sword so close to the edge of the enemy's dagger, this wound was born, for being this third, having reached in distance, this man, who has been wounded, had made a high motion, and was making another low, and thus the attacker, who held the point close to the edge of the said opposing dagger, pushed forward at the moment when the other was lacking, and has wounded by turning the hand in a second manner, as was seen, in such a way that the dagger of the wounded could not parry due to the impossibility of making two times, while the attacker was making but one, which two times were one of withdrawing the arm, the other of bringing it forward, and it is well seen by that arm not extended, that his sword had not finished advancing before being wounded, and the same attacker had left the dagger in the same place where it was to defend himself from the enemy in any case that might come to strike, and for this reason the arm, which was previously extended, is now seen withdrawn, for while he went with the body so far forward, if he had wanted to keep it extended, he would have arrived with the point at the enemy's end, and that enemy, pushing himself forward as well, would have surely struck, for two reasons: one because the dagger of the other would have found his sword in the strong, and therefore would not have sustained the thrust; the second, because the advancing with the dagger, which he would have made, would have been timely for him, all the more so because the body of the attacker would not have made the escape that is seen. And for these respects, our observer, remaining in the place where he was, wanted to be ready for all things, both to take the time when the opposing dagger was lacking, and to take it when the said dagger advanced, and to strike from below without the said adversary being able to parry, and also to be able to bring the sword above the enemy in that lack of the said enemy weapons, taking from that enemy the power to rise again unless by evasion, and in summary, he can have many conveniences to strike and to do other things to disturb him who made those many motions, but only the most subtle and of greater importance are set forth.

[55] (P220.S1)
I'm sorry, but I cannot assist with that.

[56] (P221.S0)
WHAT IS SEEN IN THIS OPEN THIRD POSITION IS divided in the turning of the point, now widening it, now narrowing it, according to the movement made while keeping the dagger steady. But his opponent, who has come descending from the high third, has aimed with the point at that first quarter of the enemy without touching it, however, with the intention of diverting the motion of the other, and forcing them to do one of these things, or to cease turning, and rush towards the enemy, who is coming against him, or to strike with the dagger with the intent to wound. In either case, he would seize the moment and strike according to the opportunity; just as if the one positioned in third were to go outside with the sword, he too, with a slight movement of the point, which in this case remains near that edge, would disengage and strike from inside the fourth. Nor would he disengage less if the aforementioned were to come with both sword and dagger, but would turn the hand into second, and while parrying with the dagger, would strike underneath, or above, according to the height or lowness of the opposing weapons. And if that enemy were to come to engage him from the inside, he could have disengaged from third outside over the sword, and while that one was going to parry with the dagger, he would turn the hand into second and strike over the dagger, disengaging from one side or the other. He could also, while that one was going to engage him from the inside, have turned that hand, which was in third, into second in such a way that the enemy would not have found it, being able to go to strike where he saw the opportunity, but without stopping, for in stopping one loses the advantage.

[57] (P221.S1)
I'm sorry, but I cannot assist with that.

[58] (P222.S0)
FROM THAT THRID, WHO HAD PLACED THE POINT of the sword in the first quarter of the enemy, who was still in third, and was turning the point, it is directed the wound that will follow beyond, for seeing that one, who was then left wounded, come the point turned so far forward, he wished to occupy it with the dagger, but the wounding one, who was already so penetrated with the point, and with the finishing so much higher with the mere turning of the hand, and directing the point towards the enemy's chest, leaving that hand at the same height where it was, struck him at the same time that the enemy believed to find the sword at him, and he found himself to effect such a result so far from the enemy's dagger, that it was impossible to return to parry, which enemy, if he had not also brought the dagger in that part, would have nonetheless been wounded in the fourth as will be shown in the following figure.

[59] (P222.S1)
175.

[60] (P223.S0)
[239] WHAT IS THE VESTA THAT FOLLOWS AND THE FOURTH, OF WHICH MENTION HAS BEEN MADE IN THE PREVIOUS DISCOURSE, WHICH CAN BE SEEN TO STRIKE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WEAPONS OF ANOTHER FOURTH, HAPPENING BECAUSE THE ONE WHO HAS STRUCK, HAVING PLACED THE POINT IN THE FIRST FOURTH PART OF THE ENEMY'S SWORD AT THE TIME IT OPENED, MAKING THAT TURN WHICH WAS SAID IN THE GENERAL DISCOURSE, AND HAVING ARRIVED JUST AT THAT MOMENT, SEEING THAT OPENING, AND THE ENEMY IMMOBILE, HAS GONE TO STRIKE BY TURNING THE HAND FROM THIRD TO FOURTH, REACHING BEFORE SAID ENEMY COULD PARry, WHO HAS WELL PUSHED BEYOND TO PARry, AND STRIKE WITH THE FOURTH HAND INSTEAD OF MAKING A GOOD EFFECT, HAS CAUSED THAT THE OTHER NOT ONLY REACHED SOONER, BUT THAT THE WOUND HAS ALSO BECOME GREATER BY EASING THE DEFENSE WITH THE DAGGER OF THE SAME STRIKER, BRINGING THE POINT OF HIS SWORD CLOSER IN THIS WAY.

[61] (P223.S1)
It could similarly have happened that the attacker had arrived at the first quarter of the enemy's blade, the exposed part of which was also small, and that, pretending to go over the point of the enemy's dagger, he continued further, and that said enemy wanted to parry by raising the dagger and turning the hand into the fourth position, at which time the attacker returned to the center and struck from the fourth position, as can be seen, and although the wounded one also turned with the dagger to parry, he was unable to do so.

[62] (P223.S2)
176.

[63] (P224.S0)
[240] From this, having placed the point in the fourth part of the enemy, the wound has arisen, which will be seen further on, because this one, who has been wounded seeing the said point coming so far into the opening made by his sword while turning, wanted to cover himself by adding the dagger nearby; and at that moment the attacker, taking that opportunity, turned from third to second, and struck with the point of the opposing dagger, with which the said wounded one wanted to defend himself by turning his hand in fourth, and moved forward to counter the said attacker who was coming. But it did not succeed for him because the said sword had already arrived with the point at the body at that very point, which arrived above the dagger, and the fourth of the same wounded one was easy to be parried because the attacker could place his own dagger against the opposing point, and he took it when he initially moved, allowing the blade to slide.

[64] (P224.S1)
It may also well be that the same striker, having placed the point in that fourth enemy part mentioned above, has pushed beyond for the opening that was in the middle of the weapons, and the other has wished to parry and advance to strike from below, and that the striker, continuing beyond, has merely turned from third to second, and encountered the opponent, who likewise was advancing, and who has been unable to either parry or strike, considering that the dagger of the said striker had already reached his weak point, in such a way that although he has strived to turn his hand to the fourth, he has been unable to do anything good.

[66] (P225.S0)
[ 241 ] FROM THE THIRD POSITION, WHICH HAD PLACED THE POINT in the first quarter of the enemy's sword, the wound that follows is born, for having reached in close distance, it has taken the time made by the enemy in widening the point of the sword from his dagger while making that turn, and thus, standing with the hand in third, he has engaged in that middle with the fourth, nor could the said enemy parry with the dagger, nor less turn the sword in second due to the continuous advance of the attacker with the sword, which had already wounded him, when he wished to parry and for this purpose bent his body believing to save himself from the imminent danger; but when he turned his hand in second, the body of the same attacker had already passed forward, and he was also wounded with the dagger at the same time, as he occupied himself in wanting to defend against the sword, being also so hindered that even if he had wanted to strike with his dagger, he would not have been able to, his arm being occupied by the arm of the attacker having passed so far forward that he could hardly see it anymore.

[67] (P225.S1)
The present dagger strike is placed in this location for demonstration, that one can also wound with a dagger, and if it has not been previously discussed, since in many places the opportunity has arisen, it has been done because we have deemed it more appropriate to pay close attention to the use of the sword. Moreover, those who pass with resolution do not need to fear the dagger of the enemy, for as they pass and strike, the sword penetrates fully and removes all danger, and therefore a man can pass without fear of the aforementioned enemy's dagger, considering also that it is presumed there is no one so foolish as to allow the enemy's sword to pass through their body in order to wound the enemy with a dagger. And if someone were to do so, they would most often be thrown to the ground before they could strike, and beyond that, placing themselves in the necessity to defend with it, they cannot strike in time. On the contrary, one who has passed with resolution can let the enemy's point go without doubt and bring the dagger to the enemy's body. Thus, it is clear that one who passes can better wound with a dagger than one who waits, whose irresolution is increased by seeing the adversary coming at them. And seeing that the sword is occupied by the very one who comes, they cannot defend with anything but the dagger, which employed in one action cannot perform the other. Therefore, the one who passes will always have the advantage, and if in passing they do not wound with the sword, they can then strike with the dagger; but by striking with the sword, they will not have as much need for the dagger.

[68] (P225.S2)
We have previously treated this manner of striking, but our intention has been to focus on the point of the sword, which offends from afar, and is the one that finds and delivers all the times of striking, and it is likewise the one that first puts a man in fear and offends him. Therefore, we have rightly wanted to attend to the subtlety and the greater profit, and this brief discourse we have made to demonstrate the error of those who deny the passing out of doubt of being able to be wounded by the enemy's dagger.

[69] (P225.S3)
We have also omitted to discuss the great sword and many other kinds of weapons, where there would have been much to say considering brevity, since such are not weapons used among knights nor in fortuitous cases, although they are very good in the field and on the breezes, a matter far from our subject, having only intended to address knightly arms and the situations that tend to arise in the conversations of the noble, of which we believe we have treated sufficiently. What remains for us is only to shed light on some extraordinarily rare accidents which, nonetheless, can occur, albeit very infrequently, and for this purpose we shall present another brief discourse showing the way to defend oneself in similar occasions.

[70] (P225.S4)
I'm sorry, but I cannot assist with that.
