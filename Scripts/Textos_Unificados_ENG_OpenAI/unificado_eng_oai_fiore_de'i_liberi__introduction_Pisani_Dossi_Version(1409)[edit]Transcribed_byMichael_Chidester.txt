[1] (P120.S0)
[ 6a-a ] For the palm I take as a sign, thus I refer to the dagger. With my hand I take it, with the gestures I show it to you.

[2] (P121.S0)
[ 6a-b ] With those who can overcome me in battle, I carry adorned arms with broken hands and strong arms.

[3] (P122.S0)
[ 6a-c ] Arms with keys that are in the hands of the warriors, such that they may safely defend the right side. Now let us hold the keys in our hands as if we were wielding them.

[4] (P123.S0)
[ 6a-d ] You ask why with the feet one should strike glory such as this. For in wrestling, a man is indeed brought low by the palm, which holds forth the right hand.

[5] (P238.S0)
[ 17b-t ] Yes!

[6] (P238.S1)
Masters, we are one from another divided. One acts by one method that the others do not. And thus, holding their sword in position, we shall say what is well to be said about it. To launch, it is well prepared. Of a great passing, I shall make mention.

[7] (P239.S0)
[ 17b-b ] Against the thrust of the spear, with this guard I can well defend myself.

[8] (P240.S0)
To strike more effectively and to pass more strongly against an armored opponent, in such an act I wish to stand.

[9] (P241.S0)
[ 17b-d ] Against dagger and against armed and unarmed sword, in such a manner do I wish to be found.

[10] (P242.S0)
[17b-e] This grip and position of the lady, the high one, must be defended by every means.

[11] (P243.S0)
[ 17b-f ] This sword excuses me for sword and for axe In arms and without whom can do me, let him do.

[12] (P244.S0)
[ 12b-e ] We are the fencers, and we make a point Of defending the teeth with right reasoning We do not delay in striking And we return in guard, in a varied manner.

[13] (P245.S0)
[ 12b-f ] We are the strikes called the sottani, which always remain, but I call to wound the hands. And from the knee upwards we make this action, and returning with cuts we make the lesson.

[14] (P246.S0)
[ 13a-a ] We, the mechanical strikes, go crossing from the knee upwards, damaging as we go. And we deflect the blows off the path, and we redirect the strike to wound and defend. And thus, we of the mechanical strike, in the end, with such blows, we damage the center.

[15] (P247.S0)
[ 13a-b ] We are the bridge of great offense, And to all strikes we make a question. We are more venomous than a serpent, And more than all strikes we rise up against. And we, the bridge to the strikes, say, So we do not cut, that we will sew.

[16] (P255.S0)
[ 18b-d ] I am the strong position of the teeth of the zenchiar, with which I am accustomed to prove all the guards.

[17] (P256.S0)
[ 19a-a ] I am placed briefly and with the sword I often thrust and turn in the face.

[18] (P257.S0)
[ 19a-b ] I am the tired guard of the true window, thus of the right as of that which stands, I am ready.

[19] (P258.S0)
[ 19a-c ] The Long Tail Guard is a defensive position. From here, I always make an attack. And if I step in and enter into the thrust, I come to the close play without failing.

[20] (P259.S0)
[19a-d] The position of the bicorn is what I call myself. If I have enough falsity, I do not yield nor give in.
