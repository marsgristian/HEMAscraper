[1] (P109.S0)
[ 5 ] THE TRUE WAY
TO BLOCK THE STAB 
WITH THE SWORD.

[2] (P109.S1)
As I have promised you in the Prologue, I wish to teach you how to parry the knife strikes.

[3] (P109.S2)
Know then, that one can parry the knife strike in three ways.

[4] (P109.S3)
The first is with the Sword.

[5] (P109.S4)
The second with the Sword and Dagger.

[6] (P109.S5)
The third strike with the schiuar of life.

[7] (P109.S6)
Regarding the parrying of knife thrusts with the Dagger, I have discussed it in my first Book, to which I refer the Reader.

[8] (P109.S7)
Now this first Figure shows you that if your enemy were to strike you with a knife to the head, you should go to parry with the edge, and strongly with your Sword, and at the same time strike from below to the leg, by placing the Dagger under the enemy's Sword, as the figure shows you, and immediately retreat out of measure.

[9] (P109.S8)
And if you do not wish to strike at the leg, you may strike from the side at the head, and retreat out of measure, with your weapon ready to parry and to wound.

[10] (P110.S0)
[ 7 ] THE WAY TO PARRY
THE BACKHAND WITH THE SWORD.

[11] (P110.S1)
If by chance your adversary were to strike a blow upwards towards your head, go to meet it with the edge, and strong with your sword, and immediately deliver a cut to the leg, placing the dagger under the enemy's sword, as you see in the figure, and at once retreat out of measure as described above.

[12] (P110.S2)
You could also prepare the reverse strike to deliver the knife blow to the head, and then retreat in the manner described above.

[13] (P111.S0)
[ 9 ] THE TRUE WAY 
TO BLOCK THE STABS.

[14] (P111.S1)
with the Sword, and Dagger crossed.

[15] (P111.S2)
If I were by chance a gentleman with only a sword and dagger, unarmed against an armed enemy with a heavy sword, to attempt to parry with the dagger would be perilous, for being without gloves, there is no doubt that if he seizes my hand, he will cast the dagger to the ground, or else, the dagger will not withstand such a great blow.

[16] (P111.S3)
To want to parry with the Sword will succeed well, but he will not be able to wound his adversary, except with notable danger; for one who is armed has much more heart than the unarmed, and with greater boldness he thrusts underneath, and doubles the stabs, so that the one who is unarmed is in peril.

[17] (P111.S4)
He will therefore be able to do in this way.

[18] (P111.S5)
While the enemy strikes with a dagger to the head, you should cross your sword to block it, and with the dagger, as the figure demonstrates, the dagger above and the sword below, and at the same time thrust the sword beneath that of the enemy, and deliver a thrust to the face, then retreat out of measure, and as many times as the opponent strikes, so many times will you parry in this manner, and so many thrusts will you deliver to the face.

[19] (P111.S6)
And in this manner, one can also parry a hundred knife thrusts, and it is an easy thing to strike him in the face because, as he delivers the thrust, he leans forward with his face and head, especially if the gentleman delivers the thrust with intention, advancing with the foot, and then retreats out of measure.

[20] (P112.S0)
[ 11 ] THE WAY TO PARry
CROSSED WITH THE SWORD, AND DAGGER,
AND STRIKE BACKHAND FOR THE LEG.

[21] (P112.S1)
In this way, it is very safe to parry the knife strikes.

[22] (P112.S2)
When your enemy strikes at you with a knife, defend yourself in the manner described above, and at the same instant, let loose a reverse strike to the leg, which he will not be able to parry, and his sword will remain in your dagger. But above all, let the parry, the reverse strike, and the retreat be executed all at the same time, and as many times as he strikes at you, you can defend yourself in this manner and deliver a reverse strike to the leg, or a thrust to the face as described above.

[23] (P113.S0)
[ 13.1 ] THE WAY TO PARRY KNIFE STRIKES WITH THE LIFE GUARD.

[24] (P113.S1)
This Figure shows you that if your enemy strikes at your head with a knife, at the same time you should lean back with your body as the figure demonstrates, and let the knife strike pass by, and in that very instant you should thrust where you see that the opponent is more exposed, and you will immediately return to your guard.

[25] (P113.S2)
And the thrust will be sure because the stronger your enemy strikes, the more it will be received, and then with greater difficulty it can be countered.

[26] (P113.S3)
You can still execute this thrust if your enemy strikes at you with a reverse blow to the head. While he delivers the reverse strike, pull back your waist and thrust as before, and quickly retreat out of measure.

[27] (P114.S0)
[ 15 ] THE WAY TO PARRY
THE STABS TO THE LEG.

[28] (P114.S1)
We have shown how to defend against knife strikes to the head; now let us seek the order that we teach, how to defend against knife strikes to the leg.

[29] (P114.S2)
This figure thus shows you that if your enemy were to come to strike a knife blow to your leg, you would at the same time parry with the edge, or the strong part of your sword, and immediately deliver a reverse strike to the face; for by parrying in the manner of the figure, nothing else can be derived but a reverse strike to the face, and you should immediately retreat out of measure.

[30] (P115.S0)
[ 17 ] ANOTHER WAY TO BLOCK
THE STABBINGS TO THE LEG WITH THE SWORD.

[31] (P115.S1)
In another way, one can also parry knife thrusts with the Sword, but in case of necessity.

[32] (P115.S2)
If you were to thrust at your enemy, and he parried it, and at that very moment he struck at your leg with a knife, it is necessary to parry with the Sword as shown in the figure. And as soon as you have parried, it is essential that you thrust at your enemy's face, for if he strikes at your leg, he must lower his head; thus it will be an easy thing for you to catch him in the face and wound him. Then, immediately retreat out of measure, as described above.

[33] (P116.S0)
[ 19 ] THE WAY TO PARRY
THE BACKHAND FOR THE LEG WITH THE SWORD.

[34] (P116.S1)
This is a sure way to parry a thrust to the leg.

[35] (P116.S2)
While your enemy strikes this thrust at you, parry with the edge of the Sword, turning the wrist, and immediately thrust a point to the face.

[36] (P116.S3)
And if you were to thrust, and your enemy parried it, and in that instant he were to strike a backhand blow to your leg, you would parry with the Sword as described above, and you would thrust at his face, and immediately step back out of measure.

[37] (P117.S0)
[ 21 ] PROLOGUE OF THE VIRTUE 
OF THE DAGGERS,
TO THE NOBLE READERS.

[38] (P117.S1)
In this my second Book, I have chosen not to reason further about Knife Wounds, for I would create too great a Volume if I were to depict all the ways in which they can be made.

[39] (P117.S2)
I shall briefly touch upon the various ways one can be wounded by knife stabs, and how they ought to be parried.

[40] (P117.S3)
In another Book then, which, God willing, I shall soon bring to light, I will discuss the cunning and deceptions that can be employed in delivering knife strikes.

[41] (P117.S4)
Therefore, I shall say this: that in the matter of questioning, or playing with arms, one must be careful not to strike both at the same time, but rather to wait until one is prepared to deliver a thrust to the leg or to the head of the opponent, and then to go in for the strike with certainty, as has been stated above.

[42] (P117.S5)
But if the enemy should remain in guard and wait for you to strike, you ought to strike in that part which appears most uncovered, while being careful as you strike to keep your [22] Dagger or your Sword at the guard against that of the Adversary, so that if he should strike at that very moment, you may be able to parry and return out of measure.

[43] (P117.S6)
I wish to teach you to defend yourself from two or three persons in case of necessity with knife strikes, if you were to be assaulted by two people, as often happens if you strike a direct thrust at one, the other at that time strikes at you, and if you thrust at that other, at that time you receive a thrust from that one, so that you would soon find yourself dead, as has happened to many.

[44] (P117.S7)
I therefore want you to hold the sword high in the manner of a direct thrust to defend yourselves and to offend.

[45] (P117.S8)
And if both of you, in an instant, were to thrust at each other, raise your swords straight up, and then counter.

[46] (P117.S9)
The mandritto should be executed in such a way that it almost strikes the enemy's neck, and it should be directed towards the left side.

[47] (P117.S10)
The straight thrust in this manner has two effects, it wounds, and parries at the same time.

[48] (P117.S11)
Having delivered the forehand, one may step back with the body, and place the sword under the left arm to strike with the backhand, and immediately strike with the backhand in such a manner that it begins to cut across the neck of the opponent, and then finishes by striking the right side, which is to say the forehand, and the backhand as striking in a cross, and in this way one strikes and defends, for it is necessary that your sword finds the enemy's weapons; noting that such forehands and backhands should be delivered long, strong, quick, and wide, and there is no need to pause at all, but as soon as the forehand is delivered, it is necessary to follow with the backhand, and likewise, as soon as the backhand is delivered, do not delay at all in delivering the forehand, and in summary, do as a wheel.

[49] (P117.S12)
To execute this kind of knife strikes, one must practice delivering thrusts and counter-thrusts to position the arms, quicken the leg, and to breathe, by delivering two hundred and three hundred knife strikes, and as many counter-thrusts, without ever stopping. Thus, anyone will be able to parry all thrusts, even those of three and four, while simultaneously striking and keeping enemies at bay as far as his sword is long, by striking long, swiftly, strongly, and widely.

[50] (P117.S13)
This kind of knife thrust has this virtue, that if a gentleman were found disarmed, alone with a sword, and was assaulted by an enemy fully armed, with sword and dagger, and he came at him with thrusts and cuts, he could save his life in this manner.

[51] (P117.S14)
Hold your sword as I have said above, high enough to deliver a thrust, and while your enemy thrusts, strike upwards with your sword against the enemy's blade, and immediately strike downwards towards the head, or indeed at the legs, and then quickly retreat out of measure.

[52] (P117.S15)
Because when thrusting with the sword while the enemy makes a thrust, he will throw his sword to the ground, which before he can retrieve, he may strike not just one reverse, but two, and three, and then retreat.

[53] (P117.S16)
And if the enemy were to strike him a hundred thrusts in a row, he will parry them all securely, and he can wound his enemy with a counterstrike to the face, or indeed to the legs.

[54] (P117.S17)
Moreover, this thrust has the virtue that if an adversary delivers the aforementioned thrust, or indeed a stab, by striking directly to parry it, it will be an easy matter for you to make his sword fall from his hand, by touching the enemy's arm in its weakness for having delivered the stab.

[55] (P117.S18)
I therefore urge anyone who wishes to practice in this manner of knife fighting, to parry and strike securely, which others do not, for they only strike, but do not parry, if the enemy were to strike at that very moment.

[56] (P118.S0)
[ 25 ] THE WAY TO PARRY
A THRUST, THAT COMES
to the face from the outside.

[57] (P118.S1)
In my first Book, I promised to discuss how one advances with the foot to strike, since in that I have only spoken of the firm foot, of which he who knows how to play well, and who knows how to recognize the time, will do the same things while advancing.

[58] (P118.S2)
I therefore prepare to keep my promise.

[59] (P118.S3)
If your enemy strikes at you, whether with a thrust or a cut, you can evade with your foot, knowing how to take the measure, and as you have evaded, draw your sword and deliver two or three thrusts, and immediately retreat out of measure, as you will understand in this figure, which shows you that being in guard with your right foot forward, if your enemy were to thrust at you with a dagger, at the same time you would parry with the dagger, step forward with your left foot, and deliver the thrust at the same time as the figure illustrates.

[60] (P118.S4)
When you have delivered the thrust, it is necessary to withdraw your body, draw the sword, and keep the dagger firmly against your enemy's sword, and deliver two or three thrusts, then withdraw out of measure.

[61] (P118.S5)
However, when jumping back, one must secure oneself with the sword in hand, so that when retreating out of measure, the adversary does not strike you with a thrust where you are most exposed, and thus harm you both, as often happens; but if upon retreating you place your sword upon theirs, they will not be able to wound you. Therefore, I urge you to do this in all the passes you make, to keep your sword above that of the enemy until you have retreated out of measure; for one who knows how to make a pass but does not know how to withdraw the sword, return to a guard, or save oneself from the enemy's weapon can be said to be unskilled in this profession; for if he advances with his foot, they will go to grappling, and thus both will be in considerable danger if they do not know the method of grappling.

[62] (P118.S6)
To perform these kinds of passes is not for everyone; it is only for those who are strong and skillful, and who know well how to play with a firm foot, who can recognize the time and the measure, and who have good practice. For one cannot simply say, "I want to pass at the first opportunity"; one must first observe what the enemy is doing, and according to what he does, take the time and the occasion, knowing when it is time to strike with a firm foot, when to pass, when to thrust, and when to cut.

[63] (P119.S0)
[29] THE WAY TO MAKE A PASS WITH THE FOOT, WHEN THE ENEMY thrusts a point towards the face.

[64] (P119.S1)
This figure shows you that, being in a right foot guard, if your enemy thrusts at your face, you should parry with the dagger, and at the same time step with your left foot and thrust into the flank, as the figure illustrates. Immediately you must firmly plant yourself on your feet, draw your sword, and deliver two or three thrusts while keeping your dagger steady above the enemy's sword, which, if he attempts to disengage to deliver other strikes, it is necessary that you follow with the dagger, all the while not ceasing to deliver thrusts, and retreating out of measure, ensuring yourself with your sword above his.

[65] (P120.S0)
[31] THE WAY TO MAKE A PASS WITH THE FOOT, STRIKING THE ENEMY WITH A POINT TO THE CHEST.

[66] (P120.S1)
This figure shows you that if the enemy thrusts a point at your chest, you should parry with the dagger, and at the same time, step forward and strike with the point, as the figure demonstrates; and after delivering the thrust, you should withdraw your sword and return out of measure, securing yourself with your sword over theirs, and remain with your arms ready to parry and strike.

[67] (P121.S0)
[ 33 ] THE WAY TO PASS OVER THE ENEMY, WHILE HE IS IN GUARD, exposing the right side.

[68] (P121.S1)
As one can pass when the adversary strikes at you with any blow, whether thrust or cut; so, with the enemy in whatever guard they may be, you can pass, being attentive to which guard they adopt, and considering from where they are most exposed, and from that side assault them, being careful to watch where the enemy's sword is, so that while you pass you may prevent them from wounding or harming you.

[69] (P121.S2)
This figure demonstrates that if your enemy stands in a guard with the right side exposed, you must go to close in from the outside, and as you are in measure or he remains firm in guard, you must thrust, step forward with your foot, and place the dagger upon the enemy's sword, and these actions should be done simultaneously.

[70] (P121.S3)
And if by chance the enemy, while you place the dagger upon his sword, should strike to wound you, follow him, and in the meantime strike.

[71] (P121.S4)
Having delivered the first thrust, draw your sword out of measure, and secure it as described above.

[72] (P121.S5)
Adding to this, if the adversary parries your first thrust, you would be equal.

[73] (P122.S0)
[ 35 ] THE TRUE WAY TO PASS WITH THE FOOT, AND TO STRIKE ABOVE THE PUGNALE.

[74] (P122.S1)
I believe you will recognize that this figure shows you how to strike above the dagger.

[75] (P122.S2)
So, when you see your enemy in a guard with the dagger low; the sword can be as you wish, whether low or high does not matter, for your dagger must always be in guard of his sword, and where you see the enemy's sword, go slowly to close in on the guard of his sword, and when you are in measure, if he stands in guard to await you, thrust strongly while stepping forward, and with the dagger above the enemy's sword as shown in the figure.

[76] (P122.S3)
To make these passes more perfect, it is necessary that as you are in measure, you first extend your arm, and then step forward with your foot, so that you deliver the thrust so quickly that he will not notice it, as I have fully shown in my first Book. Take heed that as your enemy stands in whatever guard he may choose, and as you approach to close in on him, and you are in measure to want to pass, be careful that he does not strike you during that time. But as you see that he wishes to strike, be attentive to parry his thrust first, and then pass as we have said above.

[77] (P123.S0)
[ 37 ] THE WAY TO PASS 
WHEN THE ENEMY HAS EXPOSED HIS CHEST.

[78] (P123.S1)
If your enemy has exposed his chest, whether his sword is high or low and is in guard waiting for you, in a narrow guard, approach him slowly, until you are within measure, and as you reach the designated point, proceed as described above, first pulling the arm of the sword from where it is most exposed, then stepping forward, securing yourself from the enemy's sword with your dagger, as mentioned above, returning to deliver the same thrusts, and greeting in the same manner.

[79] (P123.S2)
In this second Book, I have intended to do nothing other than these three lessons of striking when the enemy is in the guard of waiting for you, which, if I am not mistaken, will give you insight into how to pass through all the guards that the enemy might make, serving yourself in the manner described.

[80] (P124.S0)
[ 39 ] THE WAY TO BLOCK
THE STRIKE TO THE HEAD,
and to step forward, and to cross the Sword, and the Dagger.

[81] (P124.S1)
This figure shows you that if your enemy were to strike you with a knife to the head, you should parry crosswise, step aside, and give him a thrust to the leg with three or four stabs, and then salute.

[82] (P124.S2)
It is done in this manner while standing in the guard of the straight foot, before your enemy strikes a knife blow to your head, cross the sword and the dagger, and go to meet the thrust, stepping with the left foot, as you see in the figure, and immediately deliver the reverse strike to the leg, by withdrawing at the waist, so that the sword of the adversary will remain on your dagger, and deliver three or four thrusts, and step out of measure, securing your sword on his as described above.

[83] (P125.S0)
[ 42 ] THE WAY TO GO
AGAINST ALL THE GUARDS, AND STRIKE
in various ways while the enemy draws the Sword.

[84] (P125.S1)
I wish to show you in these four figures how to go against every sort of guard; two figures will show you how to close in, the other two how to strike, for a valiant man, who has good fencing and good practice, will not rush in recklessly, but will pay attention to what the enemy does, and will wait to close in against his guard.

[85] (P125.S2)
To walk against the guards is done in this manner.

[86] (P125.S3)
If you find the adversary in whatever guard he may be, whether high or low, or with a long sword, go to cover his sword with your own, but cover it in such a way that he cannot strike unless he draws his sword, as you see in the two figures. After you have gone to cover his sword so that he cannot offend you unless he draws it, you are secure from any attack, for in drawing it he may be wounded in several ways, as you will understand.

[87] (P125.S4)
Troubling your enemy with the sword, advance to bind him with your sword upon his, as you see in the first figures. If your enemy raises his sword to strike you, turn the knot of your hand, and parry strongly with your outstretched arm, until the adversary's sword finds itself on the ground; as you see in the figures.

[88] (P125.S5)
At that same time, step forward with your foot, and place the dagger on the enemy's sword, and thrust at him two or three times as described above, securing yourself with your sword upon his.

[89] (P125.S6)
This manner of striking is done when the enemy stands in guard with the sword before him.

[90] (P125.S7)
Go to bind it with your sword upon his, and if you see that he does not wish to draw his sword, and that he stands firm in guard, then you draw your tight, parrying strongly with your arm, and step with your left foot until the sword of your enemy is found on the ground, then you may place your dagger upon his sword, and thrust, and salute yourself in the manner described.

[91] (P125.S8)
By approaching to engage your enemy in the manner of the first two figures, many things can be accomplished.

[92] (P125.S9)
If your enemy draws the sword, even if he stands firm in guard, approach him slowly, and as you are in measure, strike where he is most uncovered while standing firm, and salute him, and you will be able to pass with the techniques you have learned.

[93] (P125.S10)
You can also do this.

[94] (P125.S11)
While you are about to close in on your enemy, and as he measures you, if the adversary draws his sword to strike at your face, parry at the same time with the dagger, and stepping forward, thrust your point into his chest, bearing in mind that you must perform all three actions simultaneously, that is, while your enemy aims the point at your face, you must parry with the dagger, step forward, and deliver the thrust; otherwise, the action would not succeed.

[95] (P125.S12)
After withdrawing from life, to make two or three thrusts, and to greet each other in the manner described above.

[96] (P126.S0)
[ 45 ] THE WAY TO STRIKE THE POINT REVERSED IN THE FACE.

[97] (P126.S1)
This is another kind of wounding, which is called a thrust and can be done in many ways.

[98] (P126.S2)
I will tell you this artifice alone.

[99] (P126.S3)
If your enemy finds himself in guard with his right foot forward, and is eager to strike you, also place your right foot forward, and expose your chest, to give him the opportunity to thrust at you. Keep the point of your sword directed towards his left side, so that the enemy remains with his dagger guarding your sword. And as the adversary thrusts, parry with your dagger, and step with your left foot, delivering a thrust from outside his sword to his face, as you see in the figure.

[100] (P126.S4)
This manner of striking greatly deceives the enemy, for by holding the sword towards the left side; he will stand on guard with the dagger to parry, imagining that as you have parried, you will thrust straight, as is customary; thus, unexpectedly, the sword finds itself in his face.

[101] (P126.S5)
Strike, when you have the thrust, beware of the sword, withdraw your body, place your dagger upon his sword, make thrusts, and salute him as above.

[102] (P127.S0)
[ 48 ] GUARD OF ARTIFICES  
TO BLOCK THE FURIOUS STRIKES  
with the right foot and the left.

[103] (P127.S1)
After you have learned to make every kind of thrust, it is necessary that you learn how they should be parried.

[104] (P127.S2)
If by chance there were one who knew as much about fencing as you do, or more than you, and was stronger than you, and more skillful, one must make use of the art of cunning, for it is not enough to know how to thrust with grace, to feint, or to pass, but one must also employ cunning and deception, and be able to guard against them in the right moments, for the essence of this science is reduced to cunning and deception, and that this is true I shall demonstrate thus.

[105] (P127.S3)
If there are two masters who are to play, they shall not make use of thrusts or stabs, but rather of good cunning and new deceit.

[106] (P127.S4)
These figures show you that if your enemy were to stand in a way to pass over you, while he approaches you closely, you should place yourself in a guard on your right foot, and expose your chest with skill, giving him the opportunity to strike at your chest as you see in the first figures. Be careful not to let yourself be caught out of measure, and while you see that your enemy wishes to pass, parry at the same time with the dagger and draw back your right foot, remaining in a stance as shown in the second figure.

[107] (P127.S5)
The enemy finds himself having passed, and similarly you find yourself disconcerted, and you find yourself having prepared his thrust, and you find yourself comfortable, and you can give him as many thrusts as you wish, and you will give him the first point while he passes, and at the same time parry, withdraw the body, and step, and strike, and immediately you will be able to return to recover the sword, and as you have delivered the thrusts you desire, step back out of measure, and save yourself in the manner above mentioned.

[108] (P128.S0)
[ 52 ] ANOTHER WAY OF GUARDING
ARTIFICE TO DECEIVE THE ENEMY
while he wishes to pass with the right foot, and the left.

[109] (P128.S1)
These figures are another way to deceive the enemy while he wishes to pass over you with either his right foot or his left foot; for although these figures are seen with the left foot, nonetheless, in the same manner, they can be used to parry the advances of the right foot.

[110] (P128.S2)
If you see your enemy approaching you with his left or right foot, put yourself in guard with your right foot, and expose your chest, giving him the opportunity to move to strike you. At that very moment he thrusts, parry with your sword, and step back with your foot and your body, and strike according to the form. Immediately place your dagger on your enemy's sword, and deliver the thrusts you desire, then step back out of measure, and salute him in the manner previously described.
