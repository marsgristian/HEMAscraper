[1] (P45.S0)
[ 2a ] ¶ Another prologue.

[2] (P45.S1)
In the year fourteen hundred and nine, on the tenth day of the month of February, I, Fiore dei Liberi of Cividale of Friuli, began this treatise, which deals with the art of fighting and combat, both on foot and on horseback, with sword and dagger, and grappling, in armor and without armor, and other matters pertaining to the art of combat. And of all these things, we shall provide remedies and counter-remedies, so that one may follow the other.

[3] (P46.S0)
The aforementioned gloss is made with all our knowledge upon a book illustrated with figures, upon which these glosses and rubrics will be based, either in number or in number. And the said figures depicted shall be divided.

[4] (P46.S1)
With regard to those things that the masters who begin their plays will carry as a sign, a golden crown upon their heads, and their scholars who follow their plays will wear a golden band under the chin, and the masters who are contrary to the other masters will have a golden crown upon their heads and a golden livery under the chin, and above each play, its gloss, which aforementioned gloss is also the illustrated book of figures painted and made at the request of the illustrious and exalted Lord Niccolò, Lord Marquis of the city of Ferrara and of the cities of Modena and Parma and of Reggio.

[5] (P47.S0)
In which gloss we shall speak with all our knowledge. And first we shall speak of embracing the feet, and then of the other things of arms, according to what you will see depicted and arranged by the said flower. And as we shall begin to embrace in the name of God and of my saint, good knight George.

[6] (P48.S0)
The embrace wants seven things: the readiness of the feet, and of the arms, and the presentation, and the breaking, and the binding, and the striking, and the injury, according to what you will see in the painted figures, and especially in the plays that earn the grips according to their knowledge and their malice.

[7] (P48.S1)
The games that are taken in concord are made of love and not of anger. And regarding the art of grappling, which is done to gain the holds, sometimes the holds are made out of anger and sometimes for life, and they are holds, and games that cannot be played with courtesy are also games perilous to play. And upon this, we will treat the games that are more advanced and stronger, and those that are most necessary in arms for greater defense of man and more security, and we will make it so that they can be understood more easily through the written words and the painted figures. And we begin first with grappling to gain the holds, and also holds made in concord.

[8] (P49.S0)
¶ Then there will be three crowned masters who will be masters of the dagger, and of the art that pertains to the dagger.

[9] (P50.S0)
Then you will find yourself with seven swords upon you that signify the seven strikes of the sword.

[10] (P51.S0)
¶ Then you will find a master against three students who plays the game of the sword with one hand without a shield.

[11] (P52.S0)
You can find one with a stick and with a dagger that is a master who counters one who has the spear.

[12] (P53.S0)
¶ Then you will find another master with two sticks and with a dagger against one who has a spear.

[13] (P54.S0)
¶ You will find the guards of the lance, which are six masters. The first three masters play on the right side. The other three that follow play on the left side.

[14] (P55.S0)
¶ Then you will find two kings with two swords that strike, as they launch lances and swords, and strike their own guards that must be awaited.

[15] (P56.S0)
¶ You can find two ways how one can strike someone who is below like a spear.

[16] (P57.S0)
¶ Then you will find a man with seven swords upon him, with three figures around, and if you can see what these figures and these swords signify.

[17] (P58.S0)
¶ You will find six crowned masters with their swords, and one does not carry the sword that the other does, and you will see for what reason one is divided from the other.

[18] (P59.S0)
¶ You can see the crowned masters one facing the other, who stand in the guards of the sword.

[19] (P60.S0)
¶ Then you will find two crossed masters who begin a strike from a wide stance to the throat of the companion.

[20] (P61.S0)
¶ Then you will find two other masters in the crown who have three plays of wide play.

[21] (P62.S0)
¶ Then you will find another master in the crown who has twelve students who perform their plays, and the first play is the strike of the villain.

[22] (P63.S0)
¶ Then, after these games, you will find one contrary that places the point in the face of the companion.

[23] (P64.S0)
Then you will find the crowned masters who are crossed in the middle of the sword; these masters can perform all the plays that follow directly to the end, such that there is not found another king, and thus one of those masters can perform those plays one like the other, according as one has more swiftness than the other, except that among these plays of these two crossed masters you will find five contrary masters to the said two crossed masters who engage in strict plays among themselves and especially against each other with the sword, and they are worth more in arms than without, although they are good in one art and in the other, that is, in arms and without.

[24] (P65.S0)
Then you will find a master crowned who is crossed with another from the opposite side, and their rights will be only two plays.

[25] (P66.S0)
¶ Then you will find a crowned master who makes a contrary.

[26] (P67.S0)
Then you will find a master who holds a sword under his arm to thrust it into the ground with all his strength.

[27] (P68.S0)
¶ Then you will find four scholars who make four towers of the sword, and they finish the grip of the sword with two hands.

[28] (P69.S0)
Then you will find masters crowned armed with swords in hand, who stand in their guards, one against the other, to engage in the grappling of the plays that follow, which plays are ten.

[29] (P70.S0)
¶ Then you will find four masters with three blades in guard and one guard against the other, who can perform certain plays and other plays that are in the game of the sword, which I will mention well.

[30] (P71.S0)
Then you will find yourself making thrusts with the spear, and one spear against another while mounted, and a short spear with the long one, and other parts also, sword against spear in various ways.

[31] (P72.S0)
Then you will find yourself sword to sword and the fencers of the swords, one man against the other, and take the sword and throw it from the horse in various ways, both the pro and the con.

[32] (P73.S0)
¶ You will also see the ways of the arms for various methods.

[33] (P74.S0)
¶ Yet you will see one who wishes to take another by the throat.

[34] (P75.S0)
¶ You will also see one who wants to take the reins from one hand to another.

[35] (P76.S0)
¶ You will also see a master crowned with a sword in hand, and what he can do with the sword, he could do with a spear, with a staff, and also with a sword. This master expects that from horseback the first carries the spear under his hand, the second holds it raised, the third wishes to throw his spear against that master, who is sufficient to make his plays that follow, that is, two plays.

[36] (P77.S0)
Then you will find a crowned master on horseback with a lance at the ready, who goes against another to make a thrust with the lance. This said master has a cord that is tied to his lance, and he passes the said cord through the saddle of his horse. This cord is well four braccia long or more, and with this lance, he wishes to strike the companion or throw the said lance at the neck of the companion to drag him off the horse.

[37] (P78.S0)
Then you will find a crowned master with a dagger in hand who awaits one by one, two with swords against him, and you will see his plays.

[38] (P79.S0)
Then you will see the techniques of the sword against the dagger, which I will explain well so that they may be understood clearly through the above words and for the gloss.

[39] (P80.S0)
Then you will find a single sword very cautious and worked in such a way that the first strike you deliver to the face, the companion will immediately receive the blow in such a manner that it will be a great effort to see it ever again.

[40] (P81.S0)
¶ You will also see a crowned master with a sword in hand who, having thrown a rope with the strong end of his sword, which weighs a pound or more, around the legs of the opponent, pulls him down to the ground with his sword.

[41] (P82.S0)
And above all these things mentioned above, their glosses shall be made with such declaration that they may be understood clearly.

[42] (P83.S0)
I, the aforementioned Fior, beseech my lord the marquis that this book be recommended to him, for you will never find another like it, because there are no masters who know how to create such books, nor do they understand much from the book itself. Moreover, for the long time that I have spent in making it, I am not doing it for nothing!

[43] (P83.S1)
More than anyone of such a quality as this, for my faith I feel it this year to do so, that I do not want more of these troubles for the old time that weighs upon me.

[44] (P83.S2)
God guard the lord Marquis Nichollo from this lord of the city of Ferrara, of the city of Modena, of the city of Parma, and of the city of Reggio.

[45] (P84.S0)
¶ Whoever wishes to see the art of arms in a beautiful manner, let him study in this book that the scholar Fiore has made. This book is called the Flower of Battle.

[46] (P84.S1)
Here is the translation of the provided medieval Italian text into English:

"Here I will recite the art of arms of every kind, that is of lance, axe, sword, dagger, and grappling, on horseback and on foot, in armor and without, as it should be done. And you will see the techniques with the grips, bindings, and breaks, and for combating in their plays and their measures, and of other things that I wish to show you in the book. Having examined it well, you can believe that for fifty years I have studied such art; whoever knows more in my time is in good standing."
