[ 49r ] FIFTH BOOK.

[2] (P221.S1)
The following occurs in the abundant feasts, but little ordered with the manners for the copious meal of all the dishes set forth at once, which those who are invited, without any other enjoyment, may be called sated, not without silently lamenting the gluttonous ministers, who either to avoid the toil of frequently carrying the flat burdens, or to wish to dine together at the lavish table, bring an insult to those seated around the arranged tableware.

[3] (P221.S2)
In whose damned error I do not wish to fall, I have not wanted (Wise Readers) to place at the beginning of the work before all else, but in the preface of any of its books (which is like food) to give birth to delight, both to touch your taste with the flavor of the continuous book, and to defend myself from many bites of envy in the manner that I am about to do at present.

[4] (P221.S3)
Because many are those who ignorantly say that my work ought to be lacking, since it does not contain the ways to invite the enemy to combat, in the just causes that may lead warriors to mortal struggle, nor does it pertain to the choice of the field or of the arms, and similar matters.

[5] (P221.S4)
I call them fools, for they foolishly judge that the fencer ought to possess that which is most alien to his art, as if he wished to discuss the paths of the sun and the moon. And thus I respond to them, that just as there is but one object for each of the five senses, so too can there be but one subject for any art; for the power of the art cannot have as its object anything other than the color, the audible, the sound, the gustatory, the flavor, and so on with the rest of such things. And just as it would be foolish for one to say that the ear not only can hear but also see or taste flavors, so too is he devoid of intellect who claims that the art of fencing does not only have to discern the virtue of strikes but also the causes that may promote combat, and the other aforementioned matters. And who is so blind that, upon hearing the name of the art which is fencing, derived from "to defend," does not come to the knowledge of its subject?

[6] (P221.S5)
that is to know the strikes and to give the means to know how to avoid them, and if you wish that it also judges the reason of the combatants, and to whom the choice of arms and of fighting belongs, it will be necessary that it has another name, that of fencing, and that thus it may be called fencing as well as judging, rather teaching the imperial laws, or ignorant, or heads of dulled intellect, do you not yet realize the error in which you are?

[7] (P221.S6)
Leave to our misfortune the laws to the jurists, and if you know the art of fencing, speak only of that which pertains to fencing, namely the great judgment that one must have in securing oneself from offenses, and likewise how one ought to offend the enemy; and afterwards, when you are knowledgeable in the laws, you will speak of that, but as jurists, and not as fencers.

[8] (P221.S7)
Because of one and the same thing, more considerations can be placed, just as a human body can be considered by the natural philosopher, the physician, and the astrologer.

[9] (P221.S8)
From the Philosopher, inasmuch as it is a conjunction of Soul & Body, or of matter & form.

[10] (P221.S9)
Of the physician, inasmuch as he is composed of four elements, and being subject to such passions, he judges it as a signified individual, which the Philosopher regarded as universal; but from the astrologer, the same human body will be considered purely as an individual: inasmuch as under such celestial influence it was born, it will not be permissible (let us suppose) for the physician, while he speaks of such a human body, beyond his aforementioned compositions, to also speak of the celestial influences causing them, and when he does speak of the influences, he will not speak as a physician, but as an astrologer.

[11] (P221.S10)
Thus, when two have come to the point of combat, they can be considered differently by the jurist and the fencer; by the jurist, inasmuch as the combat is just or unjust, giving reason and choice to one or the other, but by the fencer, it is considered inasmuch as the one will be secure in such a guard, and with such a strike will be able to offend. Hence, it is more fitting for the physician to speak of astrology due to the proximity of the sciences than for the fencer to speak of civic or imperial laws, although in this, fencing resembles medicine, for just as medicine begins where the Philosopher has made an end.

[12] (P221.S11)
Thus, the fencing begins its virtue, where the jurist has already made an end.

[13] (P221.S12)
Therefore, the jurist concludes when for such a reason he leads him to combat, assigning that such a fight is lawful, and the fencer takes the initiative when the weapons have already been given to him, just as the writer begins to use the paper after it has been provided by his craft; it is not for him to see what kind of rag it is made of, since he already has the pen in hand, which pertains to the master of that. And just as it happens to the writer to often write on paper that is not good, for lack of another kind, so too is it for the fencer to operate the weapons without much reason or good cause. Therefore, it is not the civil reason that makes this art good and perfect, but only the knowledge to defend and to offend, for it is evident that the subject of it is the understanding of the strikes and nothing else. If I adequately teach these in my work, in what have I failed?

[14] (P221.S13)
in what is it wrong?

[15] (P221.S14)
In which, not satisfied with all that pertains to my art: those will surely have erred (if any are so presumptuous) who, proposing to speak of the art of fencing, have treated of the aforementioned trifles, nor are they to be called near to it in any other way.

[16] (P221.S15)
Ignorant of the precept of Aristotle in the first of the Posterior Analytics, that it is not permissible to move from one genus to another, that is, from one subject to another.

[17] (P221.S16)
But to return to our subject, we shall divide this fifth book into the four games.

[18] (P221.S17)
The first and second hay of the sword with edge and guard, the first in the combat of one against another, and the second in that of two against as many others.

[19] (P221.S18)
The following play will be with the sword in the right hand, and the dagger in the left.

[20] (P221.S19)
The fourth shall be of sword and of buckler.

[21] (P221.S20)
Starting then from the first, I say that.

[22] (P222.S0)
Chapter.

[23] (P222.S1)
first of the game of sword & cloak.

[24] (P222.S2)
And if by chance you have the cloak around you, you will let it fall down from your right shoulder to the middle of your left arm.

[25] (P222.S3)
Having done this, you will immediately turn your hand outward, gathering the aforementioned falling cloak over your arm, and at once with the other hand drawing the sword in a high long grip, you will gracefully advance with your left foot.

[26] (P222.S4)
And if by chance you see your enemy in such a guard, you will tighten yourself strongly against him without making a strike, by which tightening he will either retreat or flee backward. But if he thrusts a stab with his left foot forward, you will parry towards his weak parts with your strong foot, responding to him with a counter in the manner of a descending blow across his sword arm, so that the left foot follows the right, and then, withdrawing the right foot backward in a high long tail as mentioned above, you will set yourself with the left foot forward.

[27] (P223.S0)
In which guard, finding yourself at ease, you will advance with your right foot, pushing it forward with a half thrust.

[28] (P223.S1)
Then he will immediately strike him with a half-reverse in the grip of the cloak without moving the sword from that place.

[29] (P223.S2)
Empire, that for such a blow to the fist given to him, he shall respond to you surely with a thrust, or with a forehand, or with a downward strike.

[30] (P223.S3)
And when he thrusts the point, you shall drive it with the true edge of your sword towards the ground, piercing him with a reverse thrust, wounding his chest.

[31] (P223.S4)
Either you will strike them with a reverse to the face.

[32] (P223.S5)
But if he were to make the right hand, or the downward strike, for any of these, you will advance with the left, parrying with the cloak, and reaching him with a thrust to the flanks.

[33] (P223.S6)
Having done this, you will leap back into the above-taught guard.

[34] (P223.S7)
In which, also being with the enemy [52r], and he thrusting at you with his left foot forward, he would gather that foot near the right, and then would strike with the right foot forward, and at the same time would wish to spoil you with a downward strike to the head.

[35] (P223.S8)
You shall not move at the first thrust, but as he strikes the downward blow towards your head, you will retreat with your left foot, delivering a downward strike to his sword hand, and then you will retreat with your right foot, making a half turn of the fist and positioning yourself in the previously mentioned guard.

[36] (P223.S9)
In which, being with the enemy, and he wishing to thrust at you with a point, or an overhand, or a downward strike, for each of these blows you shall step forward with your left foot towards his left side, driving the sword with the point towards the ground, and then in a manner of a wheel, turning it upwards, you shall come to gather any of the aforementioned offensive strikes.

[37] (P223.S10)
Then, by advancing with the right towards his left side, you will strike his head with a downward cut or his leg in such a way that the weak foot follows the strong, and having done this, you will withdraw your right foot back, making the aforementioned fist turn, by which you will find yourself in the aforementioned guard.

[38] (P223.S11)
You could also, in order to provoke the enemy, when he does not wish to leave his guard, thrust a half-point with your right foot forward and deliver a half-reverse strike to the thigh, thus waiting for a response.

[39] (P223.S12)
He who will thrust with the point, you shall strike him with the true edge, driving it towards the ground, and immediately you shall give him another thrust in the chest, or a reverse thrust to the face.

[40] (P223.S13)
But if he strikes with an uppercut or a downward blow to the head, you will go with your sword into the guard of the head, avoiding those, and responding with an uppercut to the head or to the leg, as you wish.

[41] (P223.S14)
And if you wish to deliver such blows to the leg, you shall step forward with your left foot, driving the false under the enemy's sword, striking with a reverse to the leg in such a way that your right foot follows the left from behind, and then you shall thrust a strike to the face, immediately leaping back, and finally returning to the guard we mentioned.

[42] (P223.S15)
But if the Enemy were the one who attempted to displace you from guard with a thrusting point and with the right foot forward in order to wound your head or your opposing leg with a reverse, when by chance you see it coming towards your head, you should first, in defense of the point, wound his hand with the sword with a half downward strike in the iron gate position.

[43] (P223.S16)
And as he draws back, you, stepping forward with your right foot, will go with the sword in the head guard, parrying the aforementioned strike and making the cloak a good protector of the head, will deliver a downward strike to his head, or to the leg if you wish.

[44] (P223.S17)
And if he were to strike the reverse for the leg, you will parry with the right in front, making at the same time a half turn of the fist, so that the tip of the sword points towards the ground, and you will strike him with the said reverse.

[45] (P223.S18)
Then immediately you will strike him with a downward blow to the head, and with your right foot stepping back you will flee, returning to your usual guard.

[46] (P223.S19)
Wishing to also unbalance the enemy from guard with a forehand or descending strike to the head, in order to evade any of these blows, you will withdraw your left foot back, delivering a half forehand strike to the arm of the sword, and similarly, while retreating with the right, you will position yourself in the usual guard.

[47] (P223.S20)
But if he strikes the forehand to the leg, you will gather your left foot back while delivering a forehand strike to the hand of the sword, and then similarly withdrawing your right into the usual guard, you will prepare yourself.

[48] (P223.S21)
And if by chance the enemy strikes a downward blow towards your head, you, stepping forward with your right foot towards his right side, will thrust a point at his face and at the arm of his sword, making yourself small beneath it, and thus from the blow you will render yourself defended.

[49] (P223.S22)
Then you will guide the left foot towards its right side, striking it with a transverse reverse to the right leg, so that the right foot retreats behind the left, and for your protection, you will thrust a stab to the side, lifting yourself backward with a leap and returning to the guard as usual.

[50] (P223.S23)
If the enemy seeks to strike your head with a direct blow or with a reverse one in defense against any such blow, you will step forward with your right foot, avoiding the incoming strike with your threatening cloak, and at the same time you will thrust a stab into his chest, and then, withdrawing your right foot back, you will assume a guard position with your sword in front for your defense, and subsequently, withdrawing your left foot back, you will settle into a narrow long tail stance with your right foot forward.

[51] (P224.S0)
Having spoken of those strikes that can be made in the high long guard with the left foot forward using the sword and cloak, I shall now add some others of no lesser usefulness that could be performed with the aforementioned sword and cloak in the narrow long guard with the right foot forward, in which being positioned.

[52] (P224.S1)
You shall keep in mind that if the enemy strikes with a downward or diagonal blow, you shall go into a guard position, avoiding his strike with a sudden response of a downward thrust to the leg, and then for your protection, you will withdraw your right foot backward, simultaneously pushing forward a point, so that you may be in a guard position facing him, accompanied by the cloak.

[53] (P224.S2)
Then you will gather your left foot back, turning the hand of the sword, for which turning you will position yourself in the aforementioned guard of the tight long tail with your right foot forward.

[54] (P224.S3)
You could also, contrary to the forehand, thrust a point towards his face, lowering your small sword, and thus defending yourself from that. Having done this, you would immediately step with your weak foot towards his right side, striking him with a reverse blow to the leg in such a way that the right foot follows the left.

[55] (P224.S4)
Then, for your defense, you will thrust a strike to the face, lifting yourself with a jump backward.

[56] (P224.S5)
After which you will return to the said guard.

[57] (P224.S6)
Or you can step forward with the left foot, avoiding the aforementioned downward strike to the head with the cloak, and having done this, you will thrust to the side, and you will lift yourself with a jump backward, returning to position yourself in the usual guard of which we are now speaking.

[58] (P224.S7)
I will raise the cloak to the head guard, giving him at that moment a half descending strike to his offending arm, so that your sword goes into the narrow iron door, and for your shield, you will withdraw your right foot back while going with the sword in the guard of the face, accompanying it with the cloak.

[59] (P224.S8)
Then you will retreat with the weaker foot, positioning yourself in the previously mentioned guard.

[60] (P225.S0)
But if by chance he strikes the forehand toward your leg, you will step with your left foot toward his right side, pushing the false edge of the sword under the aforementioned blow, and immediately you will deliver a backhand strike to his leg, in such a way that your right foot is behind the left follower.

[61] (P225.S1)
And with your shield, you will thrust a strike to the face, lifting yourself with a joyful leap backward, and in the end, finding yourself in the said guard.

[62] (P226.S0)
Either you will retreat with your right foot backward, striking him with a half diagonal cut to the arm of the sword, and then you will pull back your left foot, settling into your aforementioned guard.

[63] (P227.S0)
Thus, you will also strike with both hands in the aforementioned long, narrow tail, with your right foot forward, and wishing to offend him, you will step forward with your left foot towards his right side, thrusting a point at his face.

[64] (P227.S1)
And as he seeks to avoid that, you will step forward with your right foot, thrusting your cloak beneath his sword, and at that moment you will draw the hilt of your sword back, and you will strike him with another thrust to the flanks.

[65] (P227.S2)
Then in your guard, you will retreat with your right foot backward, striking his sword arm with a half thrust in such a way that then the sword falls into the iron guard, after which, with three or four steps, you will recover backward, placing yourself in the aforementioned guard.

[66] (P228.S0)
[ 54v ] Game of two against two with swords drawn & cloaks wielded.

[67] (P228.S1)
In this game or mortal combat, you must engage with your companion opposite to the two other similar companions, who are indeed your enemies, so that each one has his opponent in a manner of quadrangle. Having done this, you will tacitly agree with your ally to change enemies in a crossed manner, such that having your companion to your left hand or to your right, whichever you prefer, the one of you who finds himself on the left (according to the order given among you secretly) will make a semblance of thrusting a stab at the enemy who is facing him. Nevertheless, while abandoning the semblance, he must greatly advance with the right foot towards the enemy of his companion, defending himself with the cloak from the one he abandons, and striking the one who assaults at the sides with that stab that comes forth from the semblance.

[68] (P228.S2)
The companion must also act against the enemy not of his own, but of his ally, with a similar crossed movement and with a similar thrust aimed at the flanks, so that each one, finding the companion of his enemy unprepared, will have the opportunity to bring back from the noble combat the desired victory.

[69] (P229.S0)
Game of sword from edge to edge in the right hand, and with the dagger in the left.

[70] (P229.S1)
First, you will act with the left foot forward, and with the sword held high in the long tail, and with the dagger in a narrow iron guard, and by withdrawing the right foot behind the left, you will then advance with the aforementioned left.

[71] (P229.S2)
Thus done, the enemy will be compelled either to retreat or to go backward.

[72] (P229.S3)
But if he strikes you with a downward cut to the head, you will go with the dagger into the guard of the head and from there you will evade him, quickly stepping with your right foot towards his left side, and in such a movement, you will deliver a downward strike to his leg; or a thrust to his flank, so that the left leg follows the right from behind, and for your defense, you will retreat three or four steps backward into the aforementioned guard, positioning yourself.

[73] (P229.S4)
But if he were to thrust, you will parry it with the false edge of the dagger, striking him similarly in the side, in such a way that you step forward somewhat with your left foot, and for your protection, you will lift yourself back with a jump, placing yourself in the guard taught above.

[74] (P229.S5)
And if the enemy's point should come to you from the face in order to wound you, you shall defend yourself with the opposing leg of a thrust; but as he wishes to strike you with the thrust, you will thrust underneath, the false of the sword.

[75] (P229.S6)
Then immediately you will pass with the right over his weak parts, delivering a downward strike to the head or to the leg, so that the left foot follows the right, and the dagger is found in the guard of the head.

[76] (P229.S7)
Then, for your protection, you will gather three or four steps back, positioning yourself in the upper guard.

[77] (P229.S8)
If the enemy also thrusts a point to damage your head, or the opposite leg of a thrust, you will make yourself repugnant with the dagger. But as you see the thrust coming for the leg, you will also strike it with the dagger, making the point face towards the ground, and at the very same time with the sword you will thrust into his chest, or you will strike his sword arm with a false strike.

[78] (P230.S0)
Game of Sword and Shield.

[79] (P230.S1)
I will place you on one side of the sole with the sword in hand and the buckler on your arm with such grace as will be possible for you.

[80] (P230.S2)
And wanting to assail the enemy, you will step with the left foot towards his right side, advancing with the right foot, and in such a movement you will make a false and direct strike, so that the sword descends in a wide iron gate while the left foot follows the right.

[81] (P230.S3)
Then you will guide the right foot somewhat towards his weak parts, and subsequently with the left take a large step, and in this time you will make a false and reverse move in such a way that the strong foot follows the weak, and the sword will be found in a high long tail position.

[82] (P230.S4)
After you pass with your left foot somewhat towards your right side, advancing with your right foot in a great step and making a false move and a straight hand at that time.

[83] (P230.S5)
After the sword falls in the wide iron door, the left foot will follow the right.

[84] (P230.S6)
Then, passing the straight somewhat towards your left side and subsequently with the left forward in a great arc, you will make a false and reverse, the right foot will follow the left from behind and the sword will be found in a high long tail, and thus you will have come to play.

[85] (P230.S7)
But wanting to already ignite the fight with the enemy who is now approaching, you will thrust with the left foot forward.

[86] (P230.S8)
Then you will gather the said [attack] with your right hand, letting the sword go back extended, and immediately you will step forward with your right foot, feigning to give him a downward strike to the head. But as he raises the buckler out of fear of the said blow, you will choose to do one of these two things: either you will strike his leg with a reverse thrust, or by stepping forward with your left foot, you will thrust at his side, leaping back with a jump. But in defense of the aforementioned reverse, you will retreat with your right foot, pulling a false strike beneath your buckler, and from the enemy's response, you will make yourself safe.

[87] (P230.S9)
And then you will extend the arm of the sword, returning to the long tail.

[88] (P230.S10)
Then you will guide the left foot towards his weak parts, and following with the right foot forward, you will strike him with a false and direct thrust to the hand of the sword, so that he finally falls into a wide iron gate, and the left leg follows the right; then you will advance with the right foot towards his straight parts, and then with the left foot forward in a great step, and in this time you will make a false and reverse strike to his sword arm in such a way that the right foot follows the left.

[89] (P230.S11)
Then, immediately withdrawing the weak foot behind the strong, you will thrust a point with the right foot forward, which will strike at the enemy's face.

[90] (P230.S12)
Then you will make the appearance of striking him with a reverse cut and nonetheless you will join your opposing leg with a forehand strike, and you will make your sword fall in a wide iron gate, and let the wheel be a good shield for the head.

[91] (P230.S13)
Then you will guide your left foot towards its parts in this arc, similar to the small wheel, guarding yourself from the enemy's strike by delivering a thrust to his thigh, while your right foot must follow the left.

[92] (P230.S14)
Then swiftly, for your recovery, you will thrust a stab to his side, lifting yourself backward with a leap, and you will step forward with your right foot in a great step, and at this time you will deliver a point to his face accompanied by a reverse to his thigh.

[93] (P230.S15)
Having done this, you will guide your left foot towards its rightful place, driving the false edge of the sword under your wheel, and thus you will be avoided from the forehand that the enemy could strike, giving him a reverse cut across the opposite thigh.

[94] (P230.S16)
Then you will flee with your left foot backward, moving with the sword in the guard of the face, by which movement you will be preserved from the enemy's strike.

[95] (P230.S17)
Then you will step with your left foot towards his right side, striking him with a descending blow, and the right leg will follow the left from behind.

[96] (P230.S18)
Then you will step with your left foot towards his weak parts, and likewise with the right, thrusting a point into his face and delivering a straight thrust to his leg, so that the left foot follows the right from behind.

[97] (P230.S19)
Then you will step with your right foot towards his right side and subsequently move forward with your left, executing both a false and a reverse strike, so that the sword falls into a long tail well extended backward.

[98] (P230.S20)
Afterward, you will extend your right leg alongside the left, and immediately you will pass forward with your left foot, raising the shield above, and damaging his face with a feint. Then you will retreat with your left foot, delivering a reverse strike to his face, and similarly withdrawing with your right, you will thrust a point beneath your shield, which will go into guard against his face. Subsequently, you will extend the arm of the sword, standing in a high long tail.

[99] (P230.S21)
But if the enemy strikes at you with any blow, you will give him a false strike to the hand with the sword beneath your shield, and immediately return to your guard.

[100] (P230.S22)
Then you will deliver a thrust with the left foot forward, withdrawing said foot afterward, while the right foot and the sword go extended backward.

[101] (P230.S23)
And suddenly I will strike with my right foot forward, hitting him on the head with a downward cut, so that he falls into the wide iron gate.

[102] (P230.S24)
Then you will draw the right foot back to the left.

[103] (P230.S25)
And as he wishes to signal to you with some strike, you, stepping forward with your right foot, will evade him with a false move, striking his head or the opposite leg with a reverse blow; and for your defense, you will retreat with your right foot, thrusting a point beneath your shield, which will place you in a guard facing him, and from his strike, you will defend yourself, then settling into the aforementioned high long tail guard.

[104] (P230.S26)
Subsequently, you will thrust a point into the face with your right foot forward, and when you make the strike, be mindful that the enemy finds himself with his right foot forward.

[105] (P230.S27)
Then, passing with the left towards his right side, you will strike him with a downward cut to the leg, ensuring that the wheel well guards the head, so that the right foot follows the left.

[106] (P230.S28)
Then you will thrust a stab to his face, lifting yourself with a jump backward, and thus you will act in the said guard.

[107] (P230.S29)
But if by chance he were to strike a downward thrust or a cut to the head, you will step forward with your right foot towards his right side, thrusting a point into his face from beneath your shield, which point will go straight into the guard of his face, and in such a way that you will make a small step under your sword while striking the enemy with that blow.

[108] (P230.S30)
Then immediately you will step with your left foot towards his right side, striking his opposing leg with a reverse thrust, so that your right foot follows the left, and as your shield, you will thrust a stab to his face, lifting yourself with a jump backwards, and finally, in the said high long-tail guard, you will act.

[109] (P230.S31)
And if he were to strike your leg with a forehand, you, stepping forward with your front foot, will thrust the false edge of the sword beneath your small shield, and thus you will secure yourself from such a blow, wounding him in response with a backhand to the opposite leg; then, for your defense, you will retreat with your right foot, pushing a thrust beneath your small shield, which will place you in a guard facing him.

[110] (P230.S32)
And likewise, by withdrawing the left, you will strike him with a downward blow in such a way that it falls into the narrow iron gate.

[111] (P230.S33)
Then you will thrust with your left foot forward, and subsequently you will pass with your right foot towards his weak parts, damaging his head or leg with a descending strike, which comes in a narrow iron gate, and the left foot must follow the right.

[112] (P230.S34)
Then you will gather your right foot back, also positioning yourself in a high long tail.

[113] (P230.S35)
And when he would strike you with the head of a forehand, you will deflect it with the wheel, making a half turn of your body without moving your feet, and then you will deliver a half forehand strike to his sword arm, which will settle in the iron guard. And immediately you will step forward with your right foot, pulling upwards with a false strike towards his sword hand, accompanied by a reverse strike to the thigh, and you will lower the sword in a tight long tail with your right foot forward, and in this guard, no strike can be made that is not given in this manner, nor do I judge there to be a better one in the present play.

[114] (P231.S0)
Therefore, having provided for the fight, and wishing to return gracefully to the law as is customary, you shall first gather back your right foot, making a false and direct step, so that the sword falls into the iron guard.

[115] (P231.S1)
Then, addressing the left hand in the same manner, you will make a false and reverse strike by lowering into a narrow long tail, and also with the right, by stepping back, you will execute a false and direct strike, in such a way that the sword descends into the iron guard, and finally, placing the left foot beside the right, you will widen the arm of the sword, and by bending into a high long tail, you will find yourself in the place from which you departed.
