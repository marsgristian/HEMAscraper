[1] (P174.S0)
I am the Fifth King Master for the held cavezzo of this player.

[2] (P174.S1)
Before he draws his dagger against me, by this means I will damage his arm, for the grip he has on me is a great advantage.

[3] (P174.S2)
That I may perform all covered grips and bindings of the other masters' remedies and of their schools that are before me.

[4] (P174.S3)
The proverb speaks for example.

[5] (P174.S4)
I want every student in this art to know that no defense can be learned without the taking of risks.

[6] (P175.S0)
[ 38v-a ] ¶ This is another way to damage the arm.

[7] (P175.S1)
And to come into other plays that are grapples, I make this play.

[8] (P175.S2)
I also say that if I were to be caught by a lance with such a thrust in it, either I would disengage myself, or I would break the iron spear.

[9] (P176.S0)
[ 38v-b ] ¶ This is another way to let anchor and better to unmake a lance.

[10] (P176.S1)
I also say that if I have the strength, I will strike you in the joint of the hand that holds me by the collar; I am certain that I will dislocate it, unless you manage to evade it.

[11] (P176.S2)
I want to explain the contrary. In that which the scholar comes in with the arms to dislodge the hand of the player, immediately the player takes away the hand of the scholar from the grip.

[12] (P176.S3)
And immediately with the dagger in the chest, he can ruin him.

[13] (P177.S0)
[ 38v-c ] ¶ For this manner in the ground, I wish to throw forward that the dagger may approach me.

[14] (P177.S1)
And if your dagger 
is in the middle to wound me, 
I will take the one I left 
and your dagger I will follow.

[15] (P177.S2)
That you may not offend me in any way, for with the plays of the remedies I shall make you a villain.

[16] (P178.S0)
[ 38v-d ] ¶ This is a game of letting go, except that if my foot is straight, I make yours tired!

[17] (P178.S1)
to advance,  
you could walk on the ground without fail.

[18] (P178.S2)
And if this play is not enough for me, with others, from your dagger I will make a thrust.

[19] (P178.S3)
For my heart and eye do not look elsewhere, but to take the dagger from you without delay and hesitation.

[20] (P179.S0)
[ 15r-a ] ¶ This player held me by the hair.

[21] (P179.S1)
And I immediately, before he could thrust with the dagger, with both my hands seized his weary hand.

[22] (P179.S2)
And his arm, weary, rests upon my right to dislocate the said arm.

[23] (P179.S3)
That well, I have completely unraveled it.

[24] (P179.S4)
This would make you more secure armed than unarmed.

[25] (P180.S0)
In this way, I withdraw you for the ground that cannot fail me.

[26] (P180.S1)
And I will take your dagger to not lie.

[27] (P180.S2)
If you shall be armed,  
your power shall increase, for with it I take your life.

[28] (P180.S3)
If we are armed, the art does not fail.

[29] (P180.S4)
Although one is unarmed and may soon be, from the other plays one can do much, and still this.

[30] (P181.S0)
[ 15r-c ] ¶ This cover in arms and without arms is very good.

[31] (P181.S1)
And against a strong man, it is as good to cover underneath as it is above.

[32] (P181.S2)
And this play is within the middle bind, which is the third play of the first King and the remedy of the dagger.

[33] (P181.S3)
And if the aforementioned cover is made under the hand, the student puts the player in a lower bind, that is, in the strong key that is under the third King and remedy that plays with the hand reversed to the Sixth play.

[34] (P182.S0)
[ 15r-d ] ¶ If I can turn this arm, I do not doubt that I will make you enter into the lower bind and strong key.

[35] (P182.S1)
Although being armed, one could more surely act.

[36] (P182.S2)
I could do another thing against you if I keep my tired hand steady, and with my right I take you under the knee, the tired leg, to bring you to the ground; strength does not fail me.

[37] (P183.S0)
[ 15v-a ] ¶ With crossed arms, I await you without fear.

[38] (P183.S1)
Between the voices below and the voices above, I do not take any care, for in every way that you may draw me, you shall be bound.

[39] (P183.S2)
In the middle bind, or in the undergarment, you shall be closed.

[40] (P183.S3)
Although if you wished to make the grip that the fourth King makes, remedy of dagger with his plays, it would harm you greatly.

[41] (P183.S4)
And the dagger to the right  
does not stain my hand.

[42] (P184.S0)
[ 15v-b ] ¶ This grip is sufficient for me, so that with your dagger you cannot touch me.

[43] (P184.S1)
The play that I have behind me, I wish to make it for you.

[44] (P184.S2)
And many other plays you could make without any doubt.

[45] (P184.S3)
I leave the others for this, as it is good for me and well suited.

[46] (P185.S0)
[ 15v-c ] ¶ This Scholar who is before me, this is his play, for this I make this dagger guard in his place, that he holds his dagger towards the ground straight, to take the dagger as it is written above.

[47] (P185.S1)
And for the turn that I shall make with the dagger.

[48] (P185.S2)
They thrust the point into his chest without failing.

[49] (P186.S0)
[ 15v-d ] ¶ So that this student cannot dislocate my arm, I keep it short and lined up.

[50] (P186.S1)
And if I had held him more closely, it would still be better, for I make the contrary of the King and master of the close play of the dagger.
