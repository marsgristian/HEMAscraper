[12] (P388.S2)

[16] (P394.S0)
[ 4r-b ] ¶ You, ashamed, will either abandon this sword or, prostrated on the ground, you will lie without anyone to prevent it.

[17] (P396.S0)

[18] (P396.S1)
Whatever you wish, I will be able to attempt with you thereafter.

[19] (P398.S0)
[ 4v-b ] ¶ I protect myself with a strong point.

[20] (P398.S1)

[29] (P403.S0)
[5v-c] ¶ Behold how strongly I hold your neck with my arm / Who, in vain, attempted to scatter you on the ground, defenseless.

but I will bind you with contrary.

[31] (P404.S0)
[ 4v-c ] ¶ You must not hinder the horse that will carry you, whose hindquarters will sit upon my chest with a roar.

[32] (P404.S1)
