[1] (P48.S0)
[ 7r ] OF THE WAY TO FIGHT AND FENCE WITH ALL KINDS OF WEAPONS DIVIDED INTO SIX BOOKS.

[2] (P48.S1)
BOOK ONE.

[3] (P48.S2)
FOR THE VALOROUS ART OF ARMS requires continuous practice for its own safety, the wretched guards, which we have ten, and they have various names. I have deemed it useful to narrate them in the first place, as they will be learned beforehand, spacious and easy to understand, and will indeed provide greater clarity to the remainder of the work.

[4] (P48.S3)
Therefore, with divine help, we shall take the beginning.

[5] (P49.S0)
[ 7v ] Of High Guard.

[6] (P49.S1)
The First Guard shall be called High, because we must gracefully confront above the person, and hold the sword grasped with the arm as lightly as you can, in such a way that the sword comes to rest behind, and the arm of the Brocchero must stretch well forward towards the Enemy as much as possible, and the right foot should be placed about four fingers in front of the left, with the heel slightly raised, and both knees shall remain straight and not bent.

[7] (P50.S0)
One can also adopt this guard in two ways, that is, either with the right foot taking a large step forward, or with the left, also with the same large step, thus holding the sword and the Brocchero as described above, and always with the sword being grasped by the arm extended in the air: with the feet positioned as you wish. It shall always be called high guard, for the name is derived not from the feet, but from the action of the sword.

[8] (P51.S0)
Head Guard.

[9] (P51.S1)
The Second is called the Guard of the Head, which is made equal and appears by extending both Arms towards the Enemy, in such a way that when you have stretched your fists, they should be found at the height of the shoulders; in this, they will only differ in that the hand of the sword must be somewhat lower than that of the Brocchero.

[10] (P51.S2)
But coming to the feet, I say that one can find oneself in two ways, either with the right or with the left forward in a great step, and nonetheless it will be the same Guard, for the reason already mentioned.

[11] (P52.S0)
[ 8r ] Guard of the Face.

[12] (P52.S1)
The Third is called the Guard of the Face, which agrees in two things with the aforementioned, and in one thing only does it disagree, for it not only agrees in the positioning of the feet, being able to oppose the right as well as the left, but also in the height of the Arms.

[13] (P52.S2)
But in this there is only the difference, that the aforementioned holds the sword across, and this one holds it straight with the point towards the face of the Enemy, and the armed hand of the Brocchero above the hand just of the sword.

[14] (P53.S0)
Of the Guard Above the Arm.

[15] (P53.S1)
The Fourth is called the Guard above the Arm, because the hand of the wielded sword comes to rest in the manner of a cross in the middle of the left Arm, holding the point back, and consequently the Arm of the Brocchero will extend greatly towards the Enemy.

[16] (P54.S0)
As for the feet, I say that in this first manner the right foot should stand so far in front of the left that it does not touch it.

[17] (P54.S1)
One could also assume this same Guard when the right foot takes a great step, bending slightly with utmost grace.

[18] (P54.S2)
And in this Guard so arranged, although the hand of the sword does not move from the place it was above, that is, from the middle of the Arm, for otherwise it would change its name for the reason stated above, nonetheless the Arms would somewhat widen, which were previously tight.

[19] (P54.S3)
Yes, let the right shoulder come to guard opposite your Enemy in a manner that seems best to you to strike him.

[20] (P55.S0)
[ 8v ] Of the Guard Under the Arm.

[21] (P55.S1)
The Fifth is called the Guard of under the Arm, because the hand of the Sword must be under the Arm of the Brocchero, that is, under the Latch, holding the sword, so that the point guards behind. But the Arm of the Brocchero should be well extended forward towards the Enemy, and concerning the feet, I say that the right one, in the manner described above, should be positioned slightly in front of the left, or in a large step.

[22] (P55.S2)
But if you hold it in a great step, it is necessary that the right shoulder adjusts towards the enemy in the manner precisely described in the fourth.

[23] (P56.S0)
Of the Guard, the narrow iron gate.

[24] (P56.S1)
The sixth guard is called Narrow Iron Gate.

[25] (P56.S2)
In which the person must position themselves sideways so that the right shoulder (as mentioned above) faces the enemy, but both arms must also extend towards the enemy, so that the sword arm stretches straight down to defend the right knee, and thus, that the hilt of the sword is near and in line with the aforementioned knee.

[26] (P56.S3)
But that of the Brocchero must remain extended and straight towards the enemy, neither up nor down for the guard of the head.

[27] (P56.S4)
The right foot should be moved forward with a great step and with the knee likewise facing the enemy, thus defended from the guard and somewhat bent, and the left foot should be placed sideways, also somewhat bent.

[28] (P56.S5)
And this is so-called the narrow iron gate, for it is the most secure of the others, and like iron, it is very strong, and unlike the wide one (of which we shall soon speak below), it constricts the sword towards the enemy, likewise tightening to the defense of the knee.

[29] (P57.S0)
Of the guard Iron Gate wide.

[30] (P57.S1)
The seventh guard is called Wide Iron Gate, and this is derived from the aforementioned, for neither the feet nor the body move in the manner described above.

[31] (P57.S2)
Only that the hand of the sword moves from the knee and descends with the tip towards the ground, going inside the right knee, and therefore it is called wide, because the sword, widening from the said knee, makes a greater exposure of the person than the previous one.

[32] (P58.S0)
Of the Boar's Guard, iron door.

[33] (P58.S1)
The O ttaua guard is called Cingiara, the iron gate, in which the left foot is positioned across by slightly bending the knee, while the right leg must remain extended.

[34] (P58.S2)
And of the hands, that of the sword must be with the fist before the left knee, as I showed in that of the iron door, where it also bears a great part of its name; but the left shall remain extended for the defense of the head with the Brocchero, as was mentioned briefly before, and thus it is said to encircle by the animal that has such a name, that while it is assailed with the head and with the fangs, it adapts itself transversely in the manner previously described to strike.

[35] (P59.S0)
Of the High Long Tail Guard.

[36] (P59.S1)
The ninth guard is called High Long Tail, with the left foot slightly bent at the knee and placed forward, while the right foot should stand straight towards the enemy at a large step. The right arm is well extended towards the enemy, but with the sword held transversely, so that the point well guards against the enemy. The arm of the Brocchero is also well extended towards the face of the enemy. And not only this guard, but also the following one originates from a guard called High Long Tail, in which, with the feet positioned as previously described, the arm with the sword is held extended behind. This name is given by translation, as it is said in common proverbs that one should not entangle oneself with great masters because they have a long tail, meaning the power to offend you with a copious following. Thus, this guard gives the same name to this ninth and to the tenth for being very suitable for reaching and offending the opponent, hence it is called High Long Tail.

[37] (P60.S0)
Of the guard of the long narrow tail.

[38] (P60.S1)
The tenth guard is called long narrow tail with the right foot advanced in a great step, in such a way that the knee bends a little sideways, and both arms should remain, as mentioned above, except that the sword arm should be positioned a little lower.

[39] (P60.S2)
And let the aforementioned guards be sufficient for our work.

[40] (P61.S0)
Chapter Two.

[41] (P61.S1)
Of the strikes.

[42] (P61.S2)
And it is to be known that all this valiant art is divided into two virtues.

[43] (P61.S3)
The first is to guard oneself first, for which the above chapter of the guards is made.

[44] (P61.S4)
The second is to know how to strike your enemy in due time, so that you cannot be harmed by him, for no true glory would you gain if you were wounded while you struck, making yourself both the victor and the vanquished.

[45] (P61.S5)
Do not wish, therefore, to make your victory a shared affair, nor to take from him his shame.

[46] (P62.S0)
But before we teach you to strike, it is necessary that the names of the blows are not hidden from you.

[47] (P62.S1)
There are five principal ones, and two are not.

[48] (P62.S2)
The first is the Mandritto.

[49] (P62.S3)
The second Reversal.

[50] (P62.S4)
The third descending strike.

[51] (P62.S5)
The fourth Stoccata, or Point.

[52] (P62.S6)
The fifth False.

[53] (P62.S7)
And because the sword has two edges, of which, the one that faces the enemy is called the true edge, and the one that is turned towards you is called the false edge.

[54] (P62.S8)
If then you will naturally strike towards the enemy with an initial blow, taking from the left ear and continuing towards the right knee, or in whichever direction you wish, as long as the blow is delivered to the left parts of the enemy, it is called Mandritto.

[55] (P62.S9)
But if you strike with the opposite, that is, in its right parts, whether low or high as you wish, it shall be called Riuerso.

[56] (P62.S10)
And if one raises the sword between the middle of the division of the two aforementioned strikes, that is, downward straight for the head, it shall be called a Fendente.

[57] (P62.S11)
But every strike that you deliver from the ground upwards towards the face of the enemy, whether from the right or from the left side, shall be called False.

[58] (P62.S12)
And if you thrust at the enemy with the point, it is known to all as a Stoccata, either with the right foot, or with the left, or from above, or from below.

[59] (P63.S0)
Besides these five, there are two others, which I do not know to be principal, because they occur only in the play of sword and Brocchero.

[60] (P63.S1)
The first is called Tramazzone, which is made with the knot of the hand that holds the sword, the one below upwards, unwinding towards your left side in the manner of a Fendente; the other is called Montante, because it is drawn from below upwards in the manner of a False that rises into High Guard.

[61] (P64.S0)
[ 10v ] Third chapter of the offenses that pertain to the high guard.

[62] (P64.S1)
Having already dealt with the guards and the names of strikes, and how they are executed, now we shall begin to teach how to strike and subsequently how to defend against those strikes.

[63] (P64.S2)
And because the best players always rest in their guards for their safety, we will teach you how to wound and strike the enemy positioned in any of the ten aforementioned guards, and then how he should defend himself, and first we will present the offenses that can be made from the high guard.

[64] (P65.S0)
Therefore, assuming that you and the enemy are in high guard, and that you are the attacker, you can strike with a forehand to his sword hand, which is above the arm, and return with a backhand also to that hand.

[65] (P65.S1)
Then rise up in the high guard, for if you make these three strikes, the enemy will not be able to strike with any blow that could harm you, for his hand would always come to clash against your sword.

[66] (P65.S2)
But if you do not wish to strike him with the aforementioned three blows, you can deliver a reverse strike to his thigh.

[67] (P65.S3)
And if the enemy strikes at the Head, meet him with the hand of the Sword in a false traverse over the arm.

[68] (P65.S4)
Now you can make a rising strike, and at that moment take a great step forward with your left foot, and go with the sword in the guard of the Head, waiting for the enemy's blow upon your sword.

[69] (P65.S5)
Having done this, you will be able to swiftly advance with your right foot towards his left side, at that moment delivering a descending strike to his head, so that the left foot follows the right from behind, and while moving with the sword in guard of yourself, it stands for your defense.

[70] (P65.S6)
Otherwise, you could also feign descending with a reverse strike to the thigh and keep a keen eye on the enemy's hand, and when he strikes at the side of your head, you should swiftly deliver a forehand strike under the arm with the hand of the sword, ensuring that the guard serves well to protect your head, while retreating with your right foot back for your safety.

[71] (P65.S7)
You could also cut a descending thrust at an uncovered iron door, so that you would have cause to receive some blow from him. You, immediately going with the sword in the guard of the head and advancing somewhat with the right foot forward, will defend yourself by delivering a straight thrust, either to the face or to the leg, likewise avoiding the head with the buckler, and then you will retreat backward with the right foot for your protection.

[72] (P65.S8)
You can also, with the left foot, thrust and strike with a thrust toward his right side, and then give him the appearance of striking him with a reverse, but throughout all this, you will strike him with a forehand.

[73] (P65.S9)
Either by making a feint to strike him with a thrust, you will strike him with a right hand.

[74] (P65.S10)
And if this does not please you, you can deliver a thrust from above, following it with a winding or two.

[75] (P66.S0)
I will strike him with a descending blow from a thrust accompanied.

[76] (P66.S1)
And thus the many ways are concluded, by one of which you can offend him who stands opposite you in the aforementioned guard, but if you were the offended, here will be set forth the contrary responses to the aforementioned offenses in brief.

[77] (P67.S0)
[ 11v ] Chapter

[78] (P67.S1)
fourth.

[79] (P67.S2)
Of the counteractions that can be made against one who has been offended in High Guard.

[80] (P67.S3)
Let the enemy strike with whatever blow he pleases to offend you, for you are in high guard.

[81] (P67.S4)
You must strike the edge of the Brocchero up and down three or four times, that is, with the downward cut and with the false edge of the sword, doing so will make you most secure against any offensive blow.

[82] (P68.S0)
You can also strike against anyone, by drawing your right foot a great step behind the left, to thrust in an upward action, which leads into a guard of the face.

[83] (P69.S0)
Chapter.

[84] (P69.S1)
fifth.

[85] (P69.S2)
Of the offenses that can be made against one who is in the guard of the Head.

[86] (P69.S3)
In this head guard, having found you both, wishing to offend the enemy, you can then strike with one hand straight to the face, or to the sides, or you may aim for the leg.

[87] (P70.S0)
I will either thrust a point to the face or deliver a thrust.

[88] (P70.S1)
I want to make it seem as if I am striking with a forehand, but instead I will pull back with a backhand.

[89] (P70.S2)
Or if you would like to make two forehand strikes.

[90] (P70.S3)
Otherwise, also, that is to make a semblance of striking with a tramazzone, and yet to wound him with a mandritto.

[91] (P71.S0)
Chapter Six.

[92] (P71.S1)
Of the counteractions that must be made against one who offends the other in the head guard.

[93] (P71.S2)
The opponents that you can make against the aforementioned offenses are these, namely, the forehand to the side, the forehand to the leg, the forehand to the face.

[94] (P71.S3)
You can withdraw your right foot a large step behind the left, and in this time you will evade the forehand, whatever it may be.

[95] (P72.S0)
And finding yourself in a high long tail, you will thrust a point to the face, and in this thrust, you will notice the right foot stepping forward with a great stride, delivering at this time a forehand to the face.

[96] (P72.S1)
But if the enemy were to thrust at you with a thrusting sword, you will parry such a thrust with your sword.

[97] (P72.S2)
And when he turns the thrusts, you shall place the hand of the sword under the guard, directing the point of your sword towards the enemy's hand.

[98] (P72.S3)
If, however, he strikes with a forehand, you shall go with the sword in the guard of the face.

[99] (P72.S4)
And while he turns a thrust high or low, you with the sword shall evade it, quickly delivering a strike in such a manner as seems best to you.

[100] (P72.S5)
But against the two downward strikes, you can counter by cutting with a half downward strike towards the hand of the sword within the edge of your buckler, subsequently adjusting your sword into a narrow iron guard. And as he delivers the other downward strike, you will evade it with a false strike, delivering a downward blow to the face, while simultaneously advancing with your right foot to have a better opportunity to wound him.

[101] (P72.S6)
But if he makes the semblance of delivering a Tramazzone to strike you with a mandritto, you will respond to that semblance by countering with a mandritto, placing your sword in a narrow iron guard, and when the enemy strikes the mandritto to hit you, you will immediately counter it with a false strike, hitting him with a reverse to the thigh.

[102] (P73.S0)
[ 12v ] Cap.

[103] (P73.S1)
seventh, of the offenses that you can make against one who is in the guard of the face.

[104] (P73.S2)
And if both of you are in guard, and wishing to offend the enemy, you can thrust a point into his face.

[105] (P73.S3)
I will provoke him with a strong downward strike, or with a horizontal cut, and if you please, with the false edge of your sword you will strike against that of the enemy, targeting his face.

[106] (P73.S4)
Either by making a thrust from below upwards, you can strike him with a downward cut.

[107] (P74.S0)
Cap.

[108] (P74.S1)
eight, of the opponents in response to the aforementioned offenses in the guard of the face.

[109] (P74.S2)
IF you have seen that while the enemy thrusts with a point, you will step with your left foot towards his right side, and in this passing, you will make a half turn with the hilt of the sword, in such a way that the enemy will be left outside, and then subsequently you will strike him in the face.

[110] (P74.S3)
But if he were to strike a downward blow, when he raises it with the hilt of the sword, you will immediately offer him the point of yours, at which fear he will refrain from bringing it down.

[111] (P75.S0)
If, however, he were to strike a tramazzone, you will defend yourself with a false guard, that is, you will well direct it towards his left side, so that not only will the tramazzone be avoided, but you will also give him the edge in the face; and if he were to strike your sword to hit you in the face, you will swiftly make a half turn with the hilt of your sword, and thus you will remain safe.

[112] (P76.S0)
But if he were to make a semblance of delivering a rising strike from below to hit you with a downward cut, you in such a manner will close together the hand of the sword with that of the buckler, and as he makes the downward cut, you, drawing your right foot back in a great step behind the left, will push the true edge into his hand with the sword.

[113] (P77.S0)
Cap.

[114] (P77.S1)
ninth, of the offenses that you can make against one in guard above the arm.

[115] (P77.S2)
You can strike with a reverse, or make the appearance of striking with two reverses, nonetheless hitting him with a forehand, and such strikes are understood to be made while both are in that same guard, and this shall be said once for all.

[116] (P78.S0)
Therefore, you can also deliver a reverse strike within the edge of the Brocchero, or feign giving him a reverse and strike him from the Right, or step with the left foot towards his right side, and while pretending to deliver a reverse, step with the right foot towards his left side and deliver a descending strike to his head, so that the left leg follows the right from behind.

[117] (P79.S0)
You can also make the appearance of pushing over the arm with a reverse thrust, nonetheless striking with a horizontal cut, or you can simultaneously make a reverse, a descending cut, and a horizontal cut.

[118] (P79.S1)
Or you can step forward with your left foot and thrust a point over the brocchero, and then pass with your right foot, and here you can deliver a straight thrust or a horizontal strike as you wish.

[119] (P79.S2)
You could also notice the right foot directed towards his right side, striking with a reverse thrust, or disengaging with a forehand.

[120] (P80.S0)
Chapter.

[121] (P80.S1)
Tenth, of the opponents against the aforementioned offenses of guard upon the arm.

[122] (P80.S2)
When the Enemy executes the aforementioned two reverses, you will first defend with your sword, and as he attempts the second, you will quickly gather your right foot next to the left and pass forward with the left, delivering at that moment a reverse thrust to his face. And if he feigns two reverses to strike with the forehand, you will throw your right foot behind the left, moving with the sword in a guard position of iron, and as he seeks to strike with the forehand, you will swiftly return with your right foot forward, striking together with the false edge of your sword, and hitting him with a reverse.

[123] (P80.S3)
But if he strikes with the reverse on the inside edge of the Brocchero, you will turn a forehand to the face.

[124] (P80.S4)
But if he were to make a reverse strike to give you a forehand, in such a case you will go into a face guard.

[125] (P80.S5)
And as he strikes to give you the aforementioned forehand, you will make a small step under the sword, parrying it, and immediately you will pass with your left foot towards his right side, thrusting him in the right temple, so that the right leg follows the left from behind.

[126] (P80.S6)
But if he were to step with his left foot to feign giving you a reverse strike, you will immediately set yourself, with your sword in the guard of the face, and as he passes towards your left side in order to deliver a downward strike, you will swiftly wound his right temple with a transverse reverse.

[127] (P80.S7)
But if he were to extend the reverse point, you would evade it with your sword, and as he strikes with the two thrusts, you would immediately go into the guard of the head with your sword, and you would evade those, striking him with a downward cut to the face.

[128] (P80.S8)
But if he strikes from the reverse, you will turn a thrust towards his hand in conjunction with the Brocchero, and if he strikes from above, you, keeping your sword in the high guard, will defend against it.

[129] (P80.S9)
But if he were to strike with the tramazzone, you, immediately stepping forward with your left foot in a great stride, will evade it with the Brocchero, delivering a thrust to his side and lifting yourself back with a jump.

[130] (P80.S10)
But if he were to step forward with his left foot and thrust a point towards your face above his arm, you will defend it with your sword.

[131] (P80.S11)
And as he steps forward with his right foot to strike you with a forehand, while the blow has not yet reached that space, you will deliver a thrust to his right thigh.

[132] (P80.S12)
And when he strikes the two thrusts, you with your right foot forward and with the sword in the guard of the head shall evade him, thrusting at his face with a point.

[133] (P80.S13)
But if he were to step with his left foot towards your right side to strike you with a reverse thrust to the face, you should immediately deliver a false strike to his right temple, so that the Brocchero is a good defender of the head.

[134] (P80.S14)
And when he unwinds the forehand, you shall immediately draw your right foot behind the left, lifting the sword arm into the air, avoiding his, and then you shall thrust your right foot forward, striking him with a responsive forehand to the head.

[135] (P81.S0)
Cap.

[136] (P81.S1)
Eleventh of the offenses that can be made against one who is in the underarm guard.

[137] (P81.S2)
You can deliver a reverse strike to the face, or perform a false strike, nonetheless delivering a true strike to the face.

[138] (P81.S3)
You could also execute a counter by retreating backward with the left foot.

[139] (P81.S4)
I want to pierce a point into the enemy's hand.

[140] (P81.S5)
With the left foot forward, raise a false guard, and at this moment thrust with a rising motion while stepping forward with the right foot and executing a Tramazzone, which descends into a narrow iron gate.

[141] (P82.S0)
Cap.

[142] (P82.S1)
Twelfth of the counter to the aforementioned offenses in the guard of the underarm.

[143] (P82.S2)
When the enemy strikes a reverse at your face, you will step forward with your left foot towards his right side, delivering in that moment a reverse strike to his right temple.

[144] (P82.S3)
But if he were to make a false strike with the following forehand, you will counter by lifting the false from your sword, and in executing the forehand, by stepping back with your right foot in a large stride, you will deliver a half forehand to his sword, placing it in the iron guard. And thus, immediately with your right foot, you will step forward in a large stride, thrusting a point at the enemy's face, and then follow with a forehand strike to his shins and legs.

[145] (P82.S4)
But if he were to strike a reverse while retreating, you shall advance with your left foot, delivering a reverse strike to the face.

[146] (P82.S5)
And when he thrusts the point through the hand of the sword, you immediately, stepping straight back with a large stride behind the left, will go with the sword in high long guard, and if by chance he strikes falsely in high guard, you will immediately go into that same guard, and while he seeks to thrust the point in an upward motion, you, withdrawing your right foot back behind the left, will go into the iron gate guard, and if he strikes the horizontal cut, you, stepping forward with a large stride with the right foot, will counter it with a false cut from the right side to the face.

[147] (P83.S0)
Cap.

[148] (P83.S1)
thirteenth of the offenses that can be made against the guard of the narrow iron door.

[149] (P83.S2)
You can either deflect a thrust, or step forward with your left foot, pushing a point to the face, and then pass with your right foot forward, delivering two thrusts.

[150] (P83.S3)
You can also make a semblance of striking a tramazzone and with all your might deliver a reverse strike to the thigh.

[151] (P83.S4)
You could also thrust a point into the face, and by stepping forward with the left foot, feign giving him a reverse strike to the head, and thus strike him with a forehand to the head, or to the leg as you wish.

[152] (P83.S5)
I will thrust with the left foot forward and then, stepping forward with the right foot in a great stride, I will strike from below upwards towards the arms, and immediately afterwards I will turn with a downward strike to the head or to the leg, and for your guard, you will make a reverse strike with the hand of the sword, stepping back with the right foot in a great stride behind the left, and this is the defense against the last two blows.

M E ntre the enemy seeks to strike you with the tramazzone while turning, he will do so with his fist; you will turn the false towards his left side, avoiding it and delivering a straight edge to his face. But if he steps forward with his left foot to thrust at your face, you will deflect that thrust into a guard of the face, and while he aims the tramazzone, you will make yourself small beneath your sword and take a guard of the face, avoiding it with the straight edge. Then you will immediately step forward with your left foot towards his right side, wounding him in the right temple with a reverse strike, such that your right leg follows behind the left.

[157] (P84.S4)
But if he pretends to give you a thrust, you will go with your sword in the guard of the face, and as he strikes the reverse to your thigh, you will immediately throw your right foot behind your left and deliver a reverse strike to the arm of his sword.
