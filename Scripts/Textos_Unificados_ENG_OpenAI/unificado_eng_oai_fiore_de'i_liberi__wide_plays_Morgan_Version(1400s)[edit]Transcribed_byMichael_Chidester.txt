[1] (P262.S0)
[ 13v ] Here begins the wide play of the sword with both hands, with little crossing; the honor will be to he who knows how to do it well.

[2] (P262.S1)
[ 13v-a ] This master who is here crossed with this player says that when I am crossed at the point of the sword, I immediately turn my sword, and if he strikes at me with a downward cut to the head, or to the arms, or if I thrust a point into his face.

[3] (P262.S2)
As you will see here, I have painted for you above.

[4] (P263.S0)
I have placed a point in your face, as my master who is in front says.

[5] (P263.S1)
I could also have done what he says, that is to have dealt with my sword, immediately when I was near crossing the right side of the other side, that is to say of the guard, I should have quickly turned my sword in the descending strike for the head and for the arms as my master has said before.

[6] (P264.S0)
[ 13v-c ] Here I cross myself for the wide play, at half sword.

[7] (P264.S1)
And immediately when I am crossed, I let my sword run over his hands, and if I wish to pass with my right foot out of the way, I can put a point in his chest as you see here drawn.

[8] (P265.S0)
[ 13v-d ] The play of my master I have understood, for I have made his cover.

[9] (P265.S1)
And immediately, he did what he said.

[10] (P265.S2)
That I struck him first in the arms, and then I placed the point in his chest.

[11] (P266.S0)
[ 14r-a ] My master who has taught me has instructed me that when I am in the half-sword position with one crossed, I must immediately advance towards him and seize his sword in this manner, to strike him with a cut or thrust.

[12] (P266.S1)
Moreover, I can damage the leg in such a way that you may see here depicted how to strike it with the foot above the back of the leg, or below the knee.

[13] (P267.S0)
[ 14r-b ] The scholar who is before me speaks of his master, and mine, who has taught him this game, and for this reason I do it.

[14] (P267.S1)
To do it without doubt, it is little for me in my peace.

[15] (P268.S0)
[ 14r-c ] This play is called the strike of the villain, and it is done in this manner.

[16] (P268.S1)
Those who must await the villain as he draws his sword.

[17] (P268.S2)
And that which awaits the strike is to stand in a small step with the weary foot forward.

[18] (P268.S3)
And in that which the villain attempts to strike you.

[19] (P268.S4)
The tired man steps off the road towards the right side.

[20] (P268.S5)
And when the right is to pass across the way, taking his strike with the middle of the sword and letting his sword rest on the ground, I immediately respond to him with the descending strike either to the head or to the arms or with the point into the chest as I have depicted here.

[21] (P268.S6)
still that I am and good.

[22] (P269.S0)
[ 14r-d ] This is the strike of the villain that I have here denounced from myself.

[23] (P269.S1)
How well I have placed the point in his chest.

[24] (P269.S2)
And thus he could deliver a strike to the head, and to the arms with the descending blow as previously mentioned.

[25] (P269.S3)
Still I am!

[26] (P269.S4)
If the player wished to strike against me, he would want to wound me with the reverse under my arms.

[27] (P269.S5)
I immediately increase the pressure on the tired one and place my sword over his, and he cannot do anything against me.

[28] (P270.S0)
[ 14v-a ] When one grabs you by the leg, disengage the belly that is in front.

[29] (P270.S1)
Or you turn it inward and strike through the top of his head.

[30] (P270.S2)
As I have depicted here.

[31] (P270.S3)
Although one with a sword in two hands should not draw it from the knee down, for it is too great a danger to do so.

[32] (P270.S4)
That he remains completely uncovered that which is between the leg.

[33] (P270.S5)
Unless one were to fall to the ground, one could indeed draw for the leg.

[34] (P270.S6)
But otherwise not standing sword against sword.

[35] (P271.S0)
[ 14v-b ] This technique that I show you, with the point in the cover, is made to give you pain, and to make you vary the cover, for by doing this play, it must be done immediately, so as not to have any doubt against it.

[36] (P271.S1)
The contrary of this play wants to be such that the player can take the right leg of the scholar, with his tired hand, and can throw him to the ground.

[37] (P272.S0)
[ 14v-c ] This play that is called exchanging the thrust, is done in such a way that when he thrusts at you, you quickly move your foot out of the way to allow the other to pass across, still out of the way, crossing his sword with your arms low, and with the point of your sword raised towards his face or chest as it is depicted here.

[38] (P273.S0)
[ 14v-d ] Of this exchange of thrusts that I have described, this is the game.

[39] (P273.S1)
That immediately the scholar who has denounced me should not place the point in the face of the player, for he would strike him, nor should he place it in the face or in the chest, or because the player was armed.

[40] (P273.S2)
Immediately the scholar should pass with the tired foot in hand.

[41] (P273.S3)
And for this manner he should take it, and his sword shall be placed.

[42] (P273.S4)
to strike well, for the player cannot flee from his sword.
