[1] (P283.S0)
[ 27v-d ] ¶ Here begins the play of the sword with two hands, in which all manner of techniques will be covered, including strikes and bindings.

[2] (P283.S1)
and disarms and grips, and throws of swords, and strikes to the ground in various ways.

[3] (P283.S2)
And there will be remedies and countermeasures for each reason that is necessary for offense and defense.

[4] (P284.S0)
[ 28r-a ] ¶ We are here crossed, and from this crossing that we make, all the plays that we follow we can perform, just as one of us does with the other.

[5] (P284.S1)
And all the plays shall follow one another as they are demonstrated and said.

[6] (P285.S0)
[ 28r-b ] ¶ For the crossing that the master has made, with the right foot forward I complete the first play, that is, I step with the tired foot and with my tired hand I pass over my right arm, and I take his maintaining of his sword in the middle of his own!

[7] (P285.S1)
"Keep your hands in the middle of the work."

[8] (P285.S2)
And with the edge and point, I can strike him.

[9] (P285.S3)
And this grip can be made with a sword of one hand and of two hands.

[10] (P285.S4)
And to cross, you must take above as much as below, for such a grip can be made.

[11] (P286.S0)
[ 28r-c ] ¶ This is another play that comes from the crossing of my master.

[12] (P286.S1)
And as it is crossed, it can make this game and the others that follow here.

[13] (P286.S2)
Thus, the player can take the player in this manner and strike him in the face with the pommel of his sword.

[14] (P286.S3)
Also, to strike him downward on the head, before he can make a quick cover.

[15] (P287.S0)
[ 28r-d ] ¶ This is another strike of the pommel.

[16] (P287.S1)
And if it can be done immediately, if I turn it uncovered, do it without doubt.

[17] (P287.S2)
That it can be done armed and unarmed.

[18] (P287.S3)
Four teeth throw flowers!

[19] (P287.S4)
of a blow to one with such a play, if he has proven it.

[20] (P287.S5)
And the sword at the neck would be able to throw you, as it does to the wretched one who is unlearned.

[21] (P288.S0)
[ 28v-a ] ¶ For the play that is before me, and as the scholar has said, I have placed the sword to your throat, and I can surely cut your throat, for I sense that you do not have any means to defend yourself.

[22] (P290.S0)
[ 30r-b ] ¶ This play is done in such a way that one strikes with the middle blow against the middle of the opponent, and immediately goes with a cover into the bind, and thrusts the sword to the neck of the companion as depicted here.

[23] (P290.S1)
To throw the pole to the ground without failure.

[24] (P291.S0)
If one covers himself from the right side, take with your weary hand his sword in this manner, and strike him with the point or with the edge.

[25] (P291.S1)
And if you wish, you can cut him with your sword to the face or to the neck in the manner that is depicted.

[26] (P291.S2)
Even though I have struck you well here, I can abandon my sword and take yours in the manner that the student does to me.

[27] (P295.S0)
[ 29r-c ] ¶ If one covers himself from the opposite side, he takes with his weary hand the entire pommel of his sword, and he thinks it through, and with the point and edge he can well strike him.

[28] (P296.S0)
[ 30r-a ] ¶ If I encounter the narrow places with one.

[29] (P296.S1)
Immediately I make this grip, so that with my sword and with bindings I am not harmed.

[30] (P296.S2)
I can still strike him with point and edge without danger to myself.

[31] (P297.S0)
When I am crossed, I come to the close play.

[32] (P297.S1)
I place the hilt of my sword between your hands.

[33] (P297.S2)
And I raise your arms with my sword in the air.

[34] (P297.S3)
And my weary arm will strike above your right hand, and I will bind your arms with my sword under my left arm.

[35] (P297.S4)
And to strike you, they will not leave you in the end, for I shall be weary.

[36] (P297.S5)
The game that I have before me that the student plays.

[37] (P297.S6)
It is my game, and that is what I want to do to you.

[38] (P298.S0)
[ 29r-a ] ¶ Of the scholar who is before me, I will explain the play.

[39] (P298.S1)
And what he said to do, I have done.

[40] (P298.S2)
The arms you bind in a middle bind.

[41] (P298.S3)
Your sword is in the prison and cannot help you.

[42] (P298.S4)
And with my wound I can do to you.

[43] (P298.S5)
I can place my sword at your neck without doubt.

[44] (P298.S6)
The game that I have before you, I can make for you immediately.

[45] (P299.S0)
[ 29r-b ] ¶ Of the play that is done before, this play is made, that when the scholar has well struck the player, he holds him by both arms with the sword well bound with his left arm, he throws his sword at the neck and puts him in this position.

[46] (P299.S1)
If I throw him to the ground, I play or complete.

[47] (P301.S0)
[ 28v-b ] ¶ When I am crossed, I pass with the cover, and I strike in your arms in this part.

[48] (P301.S1)
And this point I place in your face.

[49] (P301.S2)
And if I tire you, I will bind both your arms.

[50] (P301.S3)
Or that in this play that I fear you will take me, I will bind your sword and I will hold it by the hilt.

[51] (P302.S0)
[ 28v-c ] ¶ The grip that the scholar said before me, I make for you, I can strike you without hesitation.

[52] (P302.S1)
I hold the point of your sword, with thrusts and cuts I will make you yield.

[53] (P302.S2)
And this play breaks every tower of the sword, and the close play makes it immediately ruinous.

[54] (P303.S0)
[ 29v-b ] ¶ This play is taken from the play of the dagger, as the first master remedies, for as he places the tired hand under the dagger to take away the hand, in a similar manner this student places the tired hand under the right hand of the player to draw the sword from his hand.

[55] (P303.S1)
Or that he will place it in a middle bind as in the second play that is before the first master’s remedy of the dagger that is mentioned above.

[56] (P303.S2)
And that bind is of this scholar.

[57] (P304.S0)
[ 29v-c ] ¶ I am the counter and I act against the student who has denounced me that he wants to play dagger games according to the first master, remedying his second play that I have described.

[58] (P304.S1)
If with your sword you strike at my foot, I do not believe you.

[59] (P305.S0)
[ 29v-d ] ¶ Here I am against the scholar who wishes to play the game of dagger, as the second play that I have demonstrated, I make against that scholar.

[60] (P305.S1)
If I cut his throat, little mounts.

[61] (P305.S2)
And I can throw him to the ground.

[62] (P305.S3)
If I wish to do it quickly, I can.

[63] (P307.S0)
[ 30r-c ] ¶ This is the tower of the sword, the sovereign with which I must hold. With my sword, I think ahead, and with my hand, I grasp his arms in such a way that it is fitting to wield the sword.

[64] (P307.S1)
And then from great wounds I will make 
a remedy.

[65] (P307.S2)
The Scholar who is before me shows this play how the sword of the player is placed on the ground.

[66] (P308.S0)
[ 30r-d ] ¶ For the capture of the student who has fallen before me, the sword has dropped to the ground.

[67] (P308.S1)
You can feel it.

[68] (P308.S2)
Indeed, I can strike you without lying.

[69] (P309.S0)
[ 30v-a ] ¶ This is the middle turn of the sword, for those who know how to do it.

[70] (P309.S1)
Such a turn of the sword is done in this way, as at the first.

[71] (P309.S2)
Except that the grips are not equal.

[72] (P310.S0)
[ 30v-b ] ¶ This is another type of sword called sottano.

[73] (P310.S1)
In a similar manner, this is taken as the lower and upper zones with such a turning of the sword.

[74] (P310.S2)
For the path of the others, let this go.

[75] (P310.S3)
With the right hand loading forward, once you have it, you must maintain it.

[76] (P310.S4)
And the weary hand must follow the round turn.

[77] (P311.S0)
[ 30v-c ] ¶ In another such manner of sword play, when one is in a tight crossing, the student must place his right hand beneath his own.

[78] (P311.S1)
And take that of the player almost in the middle or well opened.

[79] (P311.S2)
and immediately let it go to the ground.

[80] (P311.S3)
And when the hand is weary of taking under the pommel the sword of the player and giving him the round turn to the reversed hand, and immediately the player will have his sword lost.
