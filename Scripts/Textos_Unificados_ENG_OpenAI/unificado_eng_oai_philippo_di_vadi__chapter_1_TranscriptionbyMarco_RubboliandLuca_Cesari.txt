[1] (P13.S0)
[ 3v.4 ] Chapter one begins.

[2] (P13.S1)
If anyone wishes to understand and know whether fencing is an art or a science, I say that you should note my opinion. Consider well this my sentiment, for it is true science and not art, and I shall demonstrate it with brief eloquence.

[3] (P13.S2)
[ 04r ] The geometry that divides and parts For infinite numbers and measures That fills its pages with knowledge, The sword is subject to its care, It must measure the strikes and the steps So that science may assure you. From geometry, the writing is born And is subject to it, and has no end, And both the one and the other are infinite. If you will note my doctrines, You will know how to respond with reason And will draw out the rose from the thorns To clarify your opinion still further, To sharpen your intellect better, So that you may respond to others: Music adorns it and makes it a subject That the song and the sound intertwine in art To make it more perfect through knowledge. Geometry and music share Their scientific virtues in the sword To adorn the great light of Mars. Now, see if my words please you And the reason that I present to you in writing And keep it in your mind so that it does not fall away.

[4] (P13.S3)
Here you respond to the truth as I have told you, for in writing there is no end; every reversal finds the right, contrary to contrary without end.
