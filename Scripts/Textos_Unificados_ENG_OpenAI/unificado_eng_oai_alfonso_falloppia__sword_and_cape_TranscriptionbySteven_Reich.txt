[1] (P11.S0)
[20] Now I shall discourse upon the sword and cloak, or ferarolo, in that form most swift and brief that is possible.

[2] (P11.S1)
There are two ways in which you can use the cloak; one where you cannot carry a dagger, and the other when you are unexpectedly assaulted, in which case you can more easily grasp the cloak than reach for the dagger, that is to say when you have the dagger behind you, and not at your side, as most people do, who, not being in a fight, carry it almost always in that manner. And when the occasion arises, when they reach for the sword, they do not find it, because they cannot reach it with their off hand, and therefore it is necessary to carry it on the right side to be completely in control of it. However, I shall not say more about the dagger now; it suffices for me to have merely hinted at the caution that a man must have when carrying arms at his side.

[3] (P11.S2)
Now, finding yourself in a place where a dagger cannot be carried, it will be easy for you to make use of the cloak or the ferrarolo; of which I say that one who wishes to wield the cloak or ferrarolo must let the part of the cloak that is on the right shoulder fall behind, and then turn the left hand upwards, that is, the palm, and grasp the edge of the cloak with the hand under the shoulder, half an arm's length or less, according to how you find yourself in the manner, and when from the shoulder you let the cloak or ferrarolo fall onto the left arm, which will remain completely covered, you will then make a single turn to the right towards the hand, and let the other part of the cloak fall low towards the leg, and this grip you will make very quickly, and do not do as many do, who wrap it all around the arm: and because you let it hang down, you have many advantages in the manner that I will tell you: having gripped the cloak as I have said, I want you to bring the left part forward in a half step, holding the sword outside under the grip, and standing in this form: if the enemy strikes a knife blow to the head, either directly or reversely, I want you to parry with the strong of the sword, meeting at that moment face to face, making the right foot with a long and resolute step forward: and if he strikes at the leg while you are in this reverse form, raise the grip of the sword a little and thrust a strike downward while bringing the right leg forward with the arm extended, and be careful to make a slight evasion, for you will enter with less danger, but not much: and if he strikes a knife blow to the leg with the right hand, I want you to go to the parry with that part of the cloak that will hang, and turn the grip immediately with a thrust to the middle of the chest, where you find the most exposed part, and be careful never to cover your face with the arm of the cloak, for the enemy could thrust a point at your waist or strike you with a knife at the leg while you cover your face; and if he were to strike a knife blow to the head directly or reversely, I do not want you to go to the parry with the cloak, but that you meet face to face, governing yourself with the strong of the sword, as I have said above; and if the enemy does these things, you will be able to follow the strike, taking advantage hand in hand, according to what the situation will bring you, being aware of what the enemy may do.

[4] (P11.S3)
And here I shall conclude the rule of sword and cloak, provided that you have understood how to wield it, and in what manner it is governed; and now we shall speak of the sword and dagger, with the advantages of the hilt, and also of using it without a hilt with the hand, as perilous as it may be.
