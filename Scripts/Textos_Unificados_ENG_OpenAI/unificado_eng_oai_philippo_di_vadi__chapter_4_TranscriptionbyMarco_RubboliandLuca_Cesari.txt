[1] (P16.S0)
[ 7v.2 ] Â¶ Chapter four.

[2] (P16.S1)
This art is so noble and gentle, it teaches man in his movement, makes the eye quick, bold, and lordly.

[3] (P16.S2)
This art teaches you to turn well, to instruct further in covering and standing strong, and it teaches the good parry of cuts and thrusts.

[4] (P16.S3)
How many are there, without number, dead,  
For the art has not been pleasing to them,  
Therefore, they have closed their doors to life.

[5] (P16.S4)
There is no greater treasure than life, and to defend it, everyone strives, to maintain it as much as they can.

[6] (P16.S5)
The art takes the goods and every worthy thing, Defends with this art the person, Brings honor and glorious insignia.

[7] (P16.S6)
How much is the praise and good to learn this art that costs you little and gives you life a thousand times.

[8] (P16.S7)
In how many ways can it take place Without seeking if it finds a costione Blessed is he who stirs another's fire, [08r] My art is new and made with reason, I do not speak of the old one, which alas To our ancestors with their opinion.

[9] (P16.S8)
If you do not wish to be devoid of honor, Measure your time and that of your companion: This is the foundation and step of the art.

[10] (P16.S9)
To the ears of the great document, And make him understand the reasons so beautiful, Why do you not give your master a lament?

[11] (P16.S10)
Let the swords always be sisters When you come to fence with someone And then take whichever you wish from them.

[12] (P16.S11)
Do not give the advantage of the sword to anyone. You would be in danger of feeling shame, and this is what everyone should follow.

[13] (P16.S12)
In the eye, knowledge and swiftness are necessary, and if strength and heart are with you, you will make each one scratch their itch.

[14] (P16.S13)
I understand well here my sentiment: The tall man wields a long sword, and the short man shall have a short sword.

[15] (P16.S14)
The strength of man breaks the guards, Natural ingenuity offers him the reins, Grants to the small man good freedom.

[16] (P16.S15)
He who knows many strikes carries the poison, He who knows little, does so with great effort, In the end, he remains winded and yet lessened.

[17] (P16.S16)
And if you hold the blade of my line and take from this art the reason, it will turn to your needs without struggle.

[18] (P16.S17)
And note well what the speech here states: Do not reveal the secrets of the art, lest you be offended for such a reason.

[19] (P16.S18)
Now understand well this other part: The sword that is longer is indeed deadly, Without danger, with it you cannot employ yourself; Make sure it is of equal measure, As I have told you in the first chapter Of our book that rises above.

[20] (P16.S19)
The sword of two hands I esteem alone, And that alone I use for my needs, Of which I sing in my book's rhyme.

[21] (P16.S20)
And if you do not wish to have shame, do not engage in a fight against more than one: For you will do towards something other than honor.

[22] (P16.S21)
If strength compels you to engage with more than one, make sure to keep in mind to take a sword that you can wield.

[23] (P16.S22)
To wield a light weapon and not a heavy one, so that you may have it entirely under your control, for its weight should not hinder you.

[24] (P16.S23)
To the need that you take another way, That you leave the point and that you adopt Other strikes to return to the place, As you will hear in my reasoning.
