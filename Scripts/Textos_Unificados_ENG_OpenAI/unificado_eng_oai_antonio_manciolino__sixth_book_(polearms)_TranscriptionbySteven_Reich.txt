[1] (P232.S0)
[ 58r ] SIXTH BOOK OF how deceived are those who say that the good art of fighting is not learned with the blunt and non-cutting swords, which I intend to show here.

[2] (P232.S1)
And for the first, I ask him, is it the intellect that takes hold, or the feet?

[3] (P232.S2)
In any case, being compelled to say that the intellect is the learner, I make another request: does the intellect grasp those very real things that are presented before it, or rather their similarities?

[4] (P232.S3)
In truth, they will not be so foolish as to presume that my disciples have learned that very same art which resides in me, but rather one similar to it; for the traveler returning from Rome carries in his mind his own Rome (though its walls would not enter his head), but rather its likeness, upon which, bending his intellect (though he were in Bologna), he would see Rome at his pleasure, as if he were within it.

[5] (P232.S4)
Thus, the similarities are so close to the truth and to the things they represent, that having those, the known things also come together, which are of two kinds: some enter solely into the intellect, like the aforementioned, and these are shown only by the one whose intellect it is; others are in other things outside of the intellect, and these are made manifest to all in the same manner, as if another had my likeness. In this way, it is inferior to the superior, for the flying birds, often seeing in the walls the naturally painted grapes, believing them to be real, are deceived, and the young Narcissus, gazing at the fountain in which his beautiful image was reflected, fell in love with it, unaware that it was his own.

[6] (P232.S5)
We also, in the sacred churches before the depicted marbles, or paintings.

[7] (P232.S6)
The true God we worship, not for the marble, or color, and not God, although His majesty presents itself to us, from which it follows that the act of adoration is good.

[8] (P232.S7)
And to descend now to the subject, it is not only the case that our art has its simulacra in the manner of the aforementioned things, such as swords without edges and other weapons of little offense, which the offensive ones represent, but even the servants of the tables (if they wish to be perfect) before they are given their willing knives to cut the true meat, they first prepare the roots and the turnips, or they set aside, and many have the lambs, and the wild things are made of crafted wood, from the cutting of which they then transfer to the true meats. Therefore, let the ignorant crowd cease to speak of what they do not know, for he who strikes with the blunt iron will strike much better than with the sharp, nor would it be that the rough disciples were trained with the offensive weapons, nor with such instruments that do not cause pain in the blows so that the novices may learn to defend themselves.

[9] (P232.S8)
But having already sufficiently dealt with the combats of the small arms, in this sixth book we shall compose the art of the halberds, no less graceful and useful than the aforementioned, which will include two games: first of the buckler and partisan, and then of two paired partisans; and in the third place, the combat of spits, and subsequently of the poleaxes and lances.

[10] (P233.S0)
Game of the Wheel & Partisan against the same Arms.

[11] (P233.S1)
I will first act with the rotella in arm, and with the partigiana in hand in the act of striking against your enemy standing with the same weapons in the aforementioned manner.

[12] (P233.S2)
And if by chance he wishes to strike you in the left leg with a thrust from his spear held in hand, you, stepping with your strong foot toward his weak parts, and turning the blade of your spear toward the ground, will extend your arm strongly forward toward his right parts, and from that blow you will evade him, in such a way that the left leg follows the right.

[13] (P233.S3)
Then you will strike him with a reverse thrust to the chest, and for your immediate protection, you will leap back with a jump, making a half-turn with the sword above your head, and returning to the position in which you initially acted.

[14] (P233.S4)
But if you wish to be the striker of the aforementioned partisanship as has been said above, and that enemy were to wish to defend himself in the aforementioned manner (as you appeared).

[15] (P233.S5)
As he passes with the right foot to avoid being struck, you will immediately leap back, and you will act in the manner described above with the left foot forward.

[16] (P233.S6)
You can also approach the enemy and make it seem as if you are thrusting a point at his face, and as he, out of fear of that, raises his shield, you will quickly change your stance with the partisan, delivering a thrust to his body, and by leaping back, you will return the partisan to your hand in the aforementioned manner, regaining your position.

[17] (P233.S7)
But if both wish to launch themselves against each other with the partisans, and the enemy is the first, you will step with your right foot between towards your right, pushing likewise the arm of the partisan outward, so that the blade points towards the ground, and the left foot follows the right from behind.

[18] (P233.S8)
Having done this, you will have secured yourself from the thrust.

[19] (P233.S9)
And if he were to launch another thrust with the partisan, you will return your left foot across towards your left side, pushing the arm of the partisan far out towards your right side in such a way that the strong foot follows the weak.

[20] (P234.S0)
And let the sword guard towards the ground, and thus you shall be shielded from this other thrust, and in the manner said of the returned pull.

[21] (P235.S0)
Another game of the aforementioned Arms.

[22] (P235.S1)
AND subsequently there is another play of the halberd and the wheel, and although it is not as beautiful as the aforementioned, it is nonetheless very useful. At the beginning, you will take the halberd with your right hand at the foot, and with your left hand the other side of it, holding the wheel in such a way that the knots of both hands are facing upwards, and that your halberd is positioned somewhat towards its right side, with the left foot slightly forward, not taking too large a step, waiting for the enemy to strike. And if by chance he were to strike you with a blow from the halberd to the leg, you will deflect that with your halberd outward towards his left side, in such a way that your right hand is somewhat higher than usual to better evade him, striking him more swiftly with a similar blow to the leg, and returning to the upper manner of striking.

[23] (P235.S2)
And if by chance he thrusts the spear towards your face, you shall lower your right hand towards the ground, so that the blade is pointed upwards, and thus you will be secured from that.

[24] (P235.S3)
Then you will thrust him with the point of the partisan in the face, or in the leg, as you wish, bringing yourself back into the accustomed position.

[25] (P236.S0)
Game of the Sole Partigiane.

[26] (P236.S1)
First, you will take the Partisan in hand in such a way that the left hand is opposite.

[27] (P236.S2)
And the left foot is greatly advanced forward.

[28] (P236.S3)
And that the knots of both hands are turned upwards, and the partizan somewhat across, and towards your left side.

[29] (P236.S4)
And if the enemy adapts in this same manner, or in any other that he wishes, each of you will be able to give the strike the beginning, and therefore if the enemy is the first to strike, delivering a thrust to the leg, you will strike it with your partisan, pushing it far out towards his weaker parts, and you will make sure that the right hand is high.

[30] (P236.S5)
And the tip of the partisan somewhat towards the ground, and thus you shall be secure.

[31] (P236.S6)
Then quickly you will strike him with a partisan to the side or to the leg, as you wish, lifting yourself backward with a leap, and acting as described above.

[32] (P236.S7)
But if the enemy were to thrust a point at your face, or with a cut, you shall lower your right towards the ground in such a way that the blade of the partisan is opposite the face of the enemy, thereby defending yourself from the aforementioned blows.

[33] (P236.S8)
Then immediately you will strike him with a partisan thrust to the side.

[34] (P236.S9)
But if he wishes to thrust at your leg, you will defend yourself from that, as was taught to you in the above-mentioned play; if it were thrust from the upper parts, you will take your partisan with your left hand near the blade, ensuring that the knots of said hand are facing upwards.

[35] (P236.S10)
Then you will step with your right foot towards his weak parts, protecting yourself from that with the sole of yours, so that the left leg follows the right from behind.

[36] (P236.S11)
But having two partisans, if he wishes to strike the second similarly, you will pass with the left across, and towards your left side making a turn of the partisan in such a way that the blade guards towards the ground, and the left hand is beneath the right.

[37] (P236.S12)
And let the right leg follow the left, moving as described above to thrust.

[38] (P237.S0)
To fight with Spiedo against Spiedo.

[39] (P237.S1)
I will position myself with the left foot forward, having the spear in hand, and the arms well extended out from the body, with the left hand low, but the right hand somewhat further back, and the blade should be directed towards the ground in the act of avoiding the enemy's strikes.

[40] (P237.S2)
And so that you understand in all the weapons used, that is to thrust with the point, and therefore we shall pass on with brevity.

[41] (P237.S3)
I say then that if the enemy positions himself as you described above and wishes to thrust at you with a stab, whether low or high, you will deflect that with your spear towards your own side, thus ensuring your safety by responding to such a thrust to his flanks, and at that time stepping slightly forward with your left foot.

[42] (P237.S4)
But if you feel yourself to be more powerful than him, you will attempt to thrust the wings of his spear with yours, and not abandoning it, you will strive to push him strongly outward towards your weaker sides, and thus you will be able to give him a thrust to the flanks.

[43] (P237.S5)
But if he were to turn guard, and came forward with the right, you would change it as he does, and this same thrust can be made with a dagger, or a spear, as you wish to say, except that due to the lack of wings, it cannot pierce like the spit.

[44] (P238.S0)
To fight with Ronca against Ronca.

[45] (P238.S1)
I will approach against your enemy with the right foot forward, and with the left hand I will take the blade at its hilt, and the right hand must be in front. In this position, you will turn towards the enemy and make the horn of the blade point towards the ground, and by slightly advancing with the right foot, you will thrust a point into his face while simultaneously pulling down with that horn a strike towards the arms, and by thrusting another point into the chest, you will retreat with a jump to a neutral stance.

[46] (P238.S2)
Then you will position yourself in another guard, that is, with your left foot forward, and with the sword in the air as if to deliver a downward strike to his head, and thus you will advance upon him.

[47] (P238.S3)
But if he were to strike a downward blow to the head, you would immediately step with your right foot toward his left side, delivering a similar downward blow to his sword, so that as you strike it to the ground, you would then thrust at his side, rising up with a jump backward.

[48] (P238.S4)
And then you will return to that guard with your left foot forward in the act of delivering a downward strike to his head.

[49] (P238.S5)
But if he were to strike to wound your leg with the right hand, or with the point, you would immediately step forward with your right foot, thereby countering the aforementioned blows with a false strike from below upwards with your sword, and then thrusting a point at his sides.

[50] (P238.S6)
But if you were to thrust the point at his face, by doing the same to him, you will still strike his edge with a forehand, then thrusting a point into his chest.

[51] (P239.S0)
To fight with the Lances in hand, one against one.

[52] (P239.S1)
You will take your lance first with your right hand, and with your right foot forward in a great step, and placing yourself as the enemy (like you) lies down, and that he be the first striker, while he having his left foot forward will take his lance in hand in order to thrust it towards you, you will respond similarly but will not move the point of your lance from the ground, and while you push him with the first thrust, you will strike him with your lance across, and towards your weaker side in such a way that you have the freedom to go and strike him.

[53] (P239.S2)
Then you will immediately step with your right foot, and then with your left, thrusting at his side.

[54] (P239.S3)
But if you wish to be the first striker, you will advance with your right foot, thrusting a lunge so that he makes that strike which you made; and as he strikes, quickly pulling your lance across, you will let it go from your hand and fall upon him over his right side. And in this time, running towards the base of his lance, you will draw your sword or dagger, which you will have at your side, and approaching him inverted, you will strike him at your pleasure.

[55] (P239.S4)
And if by chance he were to make this thrust of the lance at you, you shall give a good thrust to your lance with your right hand backward, allowing it to run through your left hand up to the iron, and in this way he will not be able to offend you, neither with sword nor with dagger; and he may also do this same thing, and because few are knowledgeable of such matters, you shall always be the advantaged one.

[56] (P240.S0)
Finding yourself again with the left foot forward against the enemy, you will step with the right foot while delivering a thrust to the chest with a reverse response, and if the enemy were to deliver such a thrust, you will feign retreating four or five steps backward, drawing your spear back with your right hand. In this motion, you will throw yourself sideways toward your right side, and here you will take the spear in hand, and as you approach him, you will thrust at his flanks, for you will find him unguarded.

[57] (P240.S1)
But if the enemy does what I have taught you above, you will take the lance in hand and follow him behind as he flees, and as he wishes to throw himself sideways, you will give him a thrust before he is able to take his lance.

[58] (P241.S0)
Moreover, when you have the lance in hand, you can make a show of throwing a thrust at him, and he, in fear of it, will flee backward with his left foot in order to take cover. Then you will run four or five steps across and towards his weaker side, and thus finding him exposed, you will deliver a thrust to his flank.

[59] (P242.S0)
You could also run towards his right side, and make the same strike which is most singular and useful when fighting one-on-one.

[60] (P242.S1)
The opposite of this is that while you see him running, you will pull your right foot back, taking your lance with your left hand, for you cannot be harmed as you are well positioned to strike (as he is).

[61] (P242.S2)
You can also thrust with your right foot forward, abandoning your left hand from the lance, pushing your right arm towards your left side, so that your right flank is opposite the face of the enemy, and the point of the lance is directed towards his left side. Here you will wait for him to strike, and as he thrusts to wound you with a lance to the side, you will step forward with your left foot, pushing your right hand far out towards your right side, and thus you will have defended yourself from that.

[62] (P242.S3)
Then you will take the lance immediately with your left hand, and you will step forward with your right, striking him in the chest with a thrust.

[63] (P243.S0)
His opposite will be that while he uncovers himself to defend, you will feign to strike.

[64] (P243.S1)
Because if he comes forward to do what you did, he will find himself completely exposed because of the appearance you created, and thus you will be able to strike him with a thrust at your leisure.

[65] (P243.S2)
If you also want to put the enemy outside for advantage, as you will see him with the left foot forward, you will change your hands holding the lance in such a way that the right is opposed to the left, and thus you will advance with the right foot.

[66] (P243.S3)
Now if you had the lance in your right hand, you would change your hand to thrust it out against your enemy, and when you see him with your right foot forward, you will recognize the enemy positioned outside.

[67] (P243.S4)
But such a change of hand you will make when you are both within, to put the enemy outside, so that he cannot harm you.

[68] (P244.S0)
But if you had the spear and were attacked by someone wielding a partisan or a halberd or a spit or another weapon, you would take the spear in the middle and ensure that you have a spear's length of advantage, and more than the length of the enemy's weapon, and thus you would be secure that if you wished to fight against a short weapon with the full length of your spear, he could more easily strike you and charge at you. And repeating once again what was said above (I will close the book and make an end), that is, of all the thrusting weapons, the proper way to wound is with the point.
