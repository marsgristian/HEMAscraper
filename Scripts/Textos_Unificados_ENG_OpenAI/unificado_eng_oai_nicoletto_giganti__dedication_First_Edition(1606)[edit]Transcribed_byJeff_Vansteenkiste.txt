[i] SCHOOL, OR THEATER, In which are represented various ways and methods of parrying and striking with the Sword alone, and with the Sword and Dagger; Where every student may practice and become skilled in the profession of Arms,

[2] (P1.S0)
[ iii ] TO THE MOST SERENE DON COSMO DEâ€™ MEDICI GRAND PRINCE OF TUSCANY, my only Lord.

[3] (P1.S1)
If the iron, drawn from the rigid mines, would prove useless, unless it received from the industrious art a form suited to human exercises: so too, in the hands of a strong soldier, it yields little fruit, if it is not accompanied by learned and prudent valor that paves the way to every difficult and victorious success.

[4] (P1.S2)
In this way, at this point, because the eternal maker delights in operating.

[5] (P1.S3)
Because almost all the noblest things, arising from our actions, receive suitable material from its hands, which then, refined and illuminated by the industry of the soul, brings forth marvelous and powerful effects.

[6] (P1.S4)

[7] (P1.S5)
which, not only in the ancient and royal annals holds the natural greatness reduced to the peak by the invincible glorious deeds of its ancestors, but reflecting upon itself all the light of the present and the past splendor, so adorns them with its own virtues, that everyone admires the most divine temperaments, and in astonishment says that such Serenity is no less fitting.

It serves us as a clear example the testimony of law, in which, the Heaven, granting every peak of perfect quality as in the most accomplished light of the present age, has in the noblest proportion of stature, of power, of joined vigor the agility, the readiness, the strength, to draw forth with His most exalted intellect the finesse of industry, of wisdom, of time, and of art, which can make a most accomplished and illustrious Captain a Most Serene and singular Prince.

[11] (P2.S0)
Where I, recognizing and admiring with the humblest affection the mature splendor of his fresh and happy years; and reading in the face of the world the secure hopes and fruits of the future age; Adoring that hand from which Italy, and the whole world, is to take secure rest and glorious protection; to that hand I offer and dedicate with humble devotion this little, I shall not call it fruit, but toil of my labors, which for this reason alone it ought to appreciate, being of matter pleasing to her; In which she will deign to bend her most Serene eye, so that, where the baseness of my intellect with the practice of this art, which I have been treating for 27 years, does not reach; may pass so many of her highest rays, that it may make the work appear in itself humble, happily to the sight of the World; and it will be together the effect of my devotion and the fruit of the Most Serene.

[12] (P2.S1)
His benevolence, to whom serving is the greatest glory, I shall pray to Heaven to make me worthy, though a most humble servant.
