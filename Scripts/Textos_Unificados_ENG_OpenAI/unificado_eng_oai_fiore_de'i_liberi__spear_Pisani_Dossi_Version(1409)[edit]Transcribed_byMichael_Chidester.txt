[1] (P361.S0)
[15b] The long spear that is used in hand, the longer it is, the more it has in its grip. These masters stand in guard with it, with a step and suddenly they counter their strikes. Many from the right side as well as from the reverse!

[2] (P361.S1)
To certainly counter it is done off the line and not in the center. The counter must be an arm in the thrust. And whoever counters will do so much more in the thrust.

[3] (P362.S0)
[ 15b-a ] In this guard, I wait with a short spear to counter and strike with the point, and I do not use it.

[4] (P363.S0)
Your spear is long and mine is short; between us, do not flee, for I will make you a coward.

[5] (P364.S0)
With my rebated lance, I will strike you in my passage, and into your chest, I will swiftly drive it home.

[6] (P365.S0)
[ 15b-d ] Of these three masters, one must strike them, and in such a way, their lance must end in the face or chest.

[7] (P366.S0)
[16a-a] We are three masters who, from our part, will play against each other. Let whoever wishes come forth, for we will not spoil him. The fourth master who finishes our plays in the art of the crown has well received his part. This guard can withstand against every attack from above and below; I cover myself with a rebound to pass. With the footwork from below and with the upper hand, I make cover and I can strike without any hindrance.

[8] (P367.S0)
[ 16a-b ] With this guard, I know how to defend myself against every spear, for I intend to hunt you down in your chest.

[9] (P368.S0)
[ 16a-c ] I strike you without fail in my turning, for I am the master of all the changing.

[10] (P369.S0)
[ 16a-d ] The art of the spear here finds its conclusion In arms and without it stands and above its defense.
