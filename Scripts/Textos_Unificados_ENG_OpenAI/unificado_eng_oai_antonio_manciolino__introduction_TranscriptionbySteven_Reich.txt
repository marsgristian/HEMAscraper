[1] (P2.S0)
[ 2 ] NEW WORK TO LEARN to Fight, & Fence with all kinds of Weapons, Composed by Antonio Manciolino of Bologna.

[2] (P2.S1)
I TURNED to the most renowned masters of the art, who reasoned about the strikes of the fencing art, to inscribe a lengthy exposition on paper in the highest and most solemn verse of the School, where it is said their chapters are written.

[3] (P2.S2)
And in truth, whoever reads this finds it to be chapters, but what is sold by the vendors of wine upon the barrels is a thing more monstrous than human.

[4] (P2.S3)
And how can it be human for you, if the gluttony and greed of the master are openly demonstrated?

[5] (P2.S4)
But as it is a human thing to play for others, and to bear witness that someone is not born of himself, so it is a rapacious and iron instinct, and according to my talent, to place in the school things that serve only for one's own profit and not that of others. These are their chapters, since in them there is nothing else contained but the putting a price on the masterly games of this art, as if the virtue of arms had fallen into such baseness that they would seek to find those who would sell the sacred members of it for a price in the schools, without considering that sharp minds cannot equally bear this yoke upon their necks, and that the art is not worthy of being subjected to a price.

[6] (P2.S5)
And wishing to take a more useful path, considering that in the school there ought to be a void to offer some instruction in the Art, it is more pleasing to me with this work to delight my students than to set the games at a price for my own great enjoyment.

[7] (P2.S6)
Indeed, it is enough for me to have from the students three things, namely Reverence, Faith, and Reward.

[8] (P2.S7)
Reverence as a master, and likewise faith, for it is fitting for the disciple to believe according to the saying of the philosopher, the commendable reward is that the students are bound to their master, for without him (this is Cicero's opinion) the arts would perish.

[9] (P2.S8)
If therefore I am satisfied with the three aforementioned things, why should I waste time on any other profit when I can enjoy myself with this my work?

[10] (P3.S0)
[ 3r ] HERE BEGIN SOME MAIN rules, or documents concerning the valiant Art of Fencing.

[11] (P3.S1)
He who wishes to play must always attach himself to the most valorous for deeds and for fame.

[12] (P3.S2)
Because just as the glory of the victor depends on the worth of the vanquished, so the loss is not blameworthy if the fame of the victor adorns it.

[13] (P4.S0)
The delight of playing with various and different players makes a man clever, sharp-eyed, and nimble of hand, for from the variety of so many practiced minds arises the wise and learned mother experience of things.

[14] (P5.S0)
While one in play has doubt about the other: one should never remain fixed in a single guard, but should quickly change to another.

[15] (P5.S1)
The reason will not be reached by any advice of the Enemy.

[16] (P6.S0)
Against those players who strike with great force, causing fear in their companion, one can do one of two things: either let him go free and suddenly evade cleverly, pretending to avoid; or throw oneself forward to evade before the blow has taken fury.

[17] (P6.S1)
One could also wound their hand, for it would make them forget to strike strongly.

[18] (P7.S0)
Just as the wounding of the hand is not counted in the play of strikes against the enemy.

[19] (P7.S1)
Because the hand is foremost in revealing itself, so in combat this is the most singular wound, because that member of the enemy must be struck, which offends you more than the others, and this is the hand.

[20] (P8.S0)
The most gentle of the strikes is the Mandritto, for it is the most gentle and noble: which is done with greater ease and danger. But to strike with the mandritto is more perilous than with the roverso: for it leaves the man entirely exposed at that moment: thus, the mandritto is more gentle.

[21] (P9.S0)
One must always keep an eye on the hand of the enemy's sword more than on his face, for there one can see all that he intends to do.

[22] (P10.S0)
It is not of little profit nor of little beauty the gentle avoidance of a strike; rather, it is of equal or perhaps greater grace than making a fine blow. For many will know how to deliver beautiful strikes, but few will have the knowledge to evade them, so that they are not harmed.

[23] (P10.S1)
And let the watchers remain satisfied.

[24] (P11.S0)
It is necessary to know the times: without which the play is imperfect; therefore, it should be noted that when the enemy's strike has passed by your person, it is time to follow him with the response, which will seem more suitable.

[25] (P12.S0)
The players: who wield short weapons: are also to take in hand the short arms.

[26] (P12.S1)
Because their virtue in the longsword would not be extended.

[27] (P13.S0)
To any anchor in playing with the short weapon, or the short sword, is of greater virtue.

[28] (P13.S1)
Because strength brings the players close together: where excellent dodgers are made: and of good eye.

[29] (P14.S0)
In every respect, it is an excellent thing to train both hands in every play of every weapon: and to know how to strike and evade with one as well as the other.

[30] (P15.S0)
Thus, we have the high guards: with the low ones, for the principle of the high guards is to strike and consequently to evade naturally, and of the low guards, on the contrary, the principle is to evade: and then to strike in succession.

[31] (P15.S1)
but in these low positions, only the thrust is a natural wound.

[32] (P16.S0)
Just as wounds cannot be made reasonably without the guards, so too should fencing not be practiced without the follow-up of wounds, while nonetheless reserving the times.

[33] (P16.S1)
For if one always shunned without responding, he would give the enemy a manifest sign of his timidity.

[34] (P16.S2)
I greet you, for with such a guard, one should not push the enemy back, for with great heart one would proceed: and indeed, the guards should be made by advancing and not retreating; both to be more able to reach the enemy and to weaken the blow of the enemy if it were to come against you.

[35] (P16.S3)
because striking you from close range can only harm you with that part of the sword: which is from the middle back towards the hilt; but a much greater harm would come from the middle forward.

[36] (P17.S0)
The good player, when he plays against one who flees, who takes away from his virtue much of grace, for seeing the other flee, cannot perform a perfect action: he must also feign to flee; therefore, he will encourage the first fugitive to come forward, and thus he will restore his play to the lost elegance.

[37] (P18.S0)
The players who strike thick blows without measure and time, although the enemy may, through misfortune, be struck by them, are nonetheless to be blamed, and are more rightly said to be children of fortune than of the art. But those are called grave and appointed players who seek, with time and grace, to wound their adversary.

[38] (P19.S0)
If one finds oneself close to the enemy, one should never strike a finished blow, for the sword should not be removed from the presence for the safety of the one who holds it; and this imperfect strike is called half-time.

[39] (P20.S0)
When two players of equal skill in the art find themselves, the reason that one does not know how to strike the companion with his safety can be, by my advice, to approach the venture in one of two ways with the hope of victory: that is, to have the eye to strike at the very same time that the enemy has struck, or he can strike where it best suits him, and then suddenly throw himself upon him, embracing him, which everyone will consider this one the victor.

[40] (P21.S0)
If someone wishes to make the enemy miss a strike that seems to reach him at that moment, it is fitting that three or four times one after the other, he should make such a strike almost in a feigned manner, and because it is customary for players to perform the Bertuccia, the adversary will be compelled to do the same: thus, you will make him deliver the strike that you desire.

[41] (P22.S0)
If you wish to strike the enemy from above, you must begin the matter from the lower parts; and likewise, if you wish to reach him in the lower parts, you will make the fight from above, for while those defended places are being fought over, it is necessary that the others remain uncovered.

[42] (P23.S0)
Because no strike can be delivered that does not reasonably succeed in some guard, it follows that in the mounting and settling of the guards the virtue of the players is demonstrated, hence a great field will be opened for victory to whoever assaults the enemy anew before he places his arms in guard, for by maintaining the thought, it will be easier to strike him.

[43] (P24.S0)
Always in fencing, whichever side you choose, a man must keep his arms well extended, for he will not only be able to deflect the enemy's blows away from himself, but he will also strike more strongly and swiftly.

[44] (P25.S0)
The use of heavy arms, and the delight in striking long and extended, nourish good breath and excellent strength, so that afterwards, when coming to grips with light arms, the man becomes more agile.

[45] (P26.S0)
In the art of the sword with an edge, one should not start from the low guards, for they are safer than the high ones, and the reason is: that finding yourself in a high guard, you may be struck by a thrust or a cut to the legs, which is not a danger in the low guards.

[46] (P27.S0)
Those who take delight in parrying the given strikes with the false edge of the sword will become valiant players, for the best and strongest defenses cannot be achieved without this, since to parry and to wound almost at the same time is thus made possible.

[47] (P28.S0)
In combat, nor in play, one should not allow oneself to be overcome by an excess of blows, nor by presumption, for it would turn against oneself and entirely give courage to the enemy.

[48] (P29.S0)
The delight in the sword alone is, in so much, greater than the other weapons, in that it is less accompanied by the human body, for one does not always have a shield, nor always a brocchero, but the sword alone can always be had.

[49] (P30.S0)
Fighting with a left-handed opponent, the continuous walking against his sword is an excellent defense, and while he strikes with a reverse from the right hand of his sword, or when he strikes from the right: also striking with a reverse through the hand: or through the arm of the sword does not doubt the trajectory it promises.

[50] (P31.S0)
Although it is a gentle and profitable thing to walk in the game, sometimes with one foot and sometimes with the other, according to the time and need, it seems to me that walking always with both feet is of greater utility.

[51] (P31.S1)
because in this way one can advance and retreat without discomfort to the person, he also adds this: that the man plays more strongly this way than in any other manner.

[52] (P31.S2)
And when I say "at equal footing": I mean that the feet should not be more than a little beyond half a arm's length apart, always accompanying the hand with the foot and the foot with the hand.

[53] (P32.S0)
No one can be called perfect in this art, just as in others, if he does not know how to teach others.

[54] (P32.S1)
Because the philosopher says in the Ethics: that the mark of the learned is to know how to teach.

[55] (P33.S0)
Playing with the two-handed sword in the wide play, you shall always keep your eye from the middle of the sword forward towards the tip, but when you come to the close play of half-sword, you shall direct your eye to the left hand, for the enemy cannot make a grip except with that.

[56] (P34.S0)
The art of the half-sword is so necessary for the knowledge of anyone who wishes to be a good player: for if he only knew how to play at wide measure, and was restricted, he would be forced, with shame and danger, to retreat, often giving the advantage into the hands of his enemy, or at least revealing to the watchers his ignorance of such an art.

[57] (P35.S0)
If one finds himself in a grapple with one more powerful and stronger than himself, he should not, by any means, resort to grappling: for in such, the weaker is compelled to lie beneath.

[58] (P36.S0)
Touching the arm's elbow to the strongest, he must greatly arm the weak.

[59] (P36.S1)
The reason in the victorious grips is that, although reason demands that the weaker should have the lighter arms.

[60] (P37.S0)
When fighting a person of great stature with a small weapon, and when the chosen arms reach the great one, one must, by all means, protect the lower parts, and not the upper, for this reason he will be more suited to strike the upper parts due to his size.

[61] (P37.S1)
But if the small one were to touch the elbow, it is fitting that he should arm the upper parts and leave the lower ones unarmed.

[62] (P38.S0)
The fighters of equal virtue, strength, and size without difference may choose their weapons.

[63] (P39.S0)
The shorter the weapons are, the more dangerous they are said to be, for that which strikes closer is of greater peril, since such blows, due to their swift arrival, cannot easily be parried: Hence the partizan follows more than the lance, and the dagger brings more danger than the sword.

[64] (P40.S0)
Playing together, it is more commendable for one to strike from a distance than for the one who strikes with the first blow; for it demonstrates rather a tendency to become cruel than to lose vigor after receiving the blow.

[65] (P41.S0)
It is not permissible, after receiving a blow, to make more than one response while advancing with a guard: therefore, with all your skill, you must make it good; for with that you can recover your honor.

[66] (P42.S0)
The strike to the head: for the excellence of such a member, it is received for three; and the strike to the foot is taken for two, considering the difficulty of making it so low.

[67] (P43.S0)
A valiant player is he who doubles the strikes.

[68] (P44.S0)
The longer weapons are to be opposed to the shorter ones, and therefore the Lance is rather to be chosen over the spear, holding it against the spear not at the base due to the danger of its length, but in the middle with some advantage.

[69] (P44.S1)
And likewise the partisan should be taken up rather than the two-handed sword.

[70] (P45.S0)
Fear is instilled in the enemy by striking them from the middle upwards, rather than from the middle downwards, for the eyes and consequently the hearts of the less valorous are easily overcome by the upward threat.

[71] (P46.S0)
One must be watchful that the enemy does not have any advantage in arms, or in anything else, for that could grant him victory.

[72] (P47.S0)
One should never reveal one's own intention of strikes to the other: but rather understand that of the adversary.

[73] (P47.S1)
The reason for contrasting with a calm spirit must lead to good the other designs: but when engaging in the game where honor lies: it is commendable to display one's skill to the opponent.
