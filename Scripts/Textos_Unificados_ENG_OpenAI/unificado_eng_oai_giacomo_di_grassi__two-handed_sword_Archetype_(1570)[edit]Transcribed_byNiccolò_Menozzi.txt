[ 93 ] OF THE GREAT SWORD.

[2] (P223.S1)
The great sword, as it is used today, with four palms of hand or more and with that large cross, has not been found suitable to be wielded alone against an equal opponent like the other weapons we have discussed. However, in order to resist many swords or other weapons with it, like a galleon among many galleys, it is used in warfare to defend the standards, so that it can confront many and protect the banners. In cities, it is often carried by night and day when it happens that few must resist many. Because its weight and size require great strength, this weapon is dedicated to those who are large in stature, robust in limbs, and strong of great heart, who, needing to resist many alone, are more secure in striking and in frightening others with the fury of the great sword. All are accustomed to wield it with great thrusts and circular reverses, sometimes standing on one foot and sometimes on the other.

[3] (P223.S2)
Leaving oneself almost entirely to the thrusting, as one who can wound and frighten a single opponent, while they wish to oppose many.

[4] (P223.S3)
This manner of fencing, besides being beautiful to behold, when accompanied by great swiftness that cannot be achieved otherwise, is also extremely useful not for its own sake, but because men, considering the great fury of the sword, out of great fear do not resolve to do what they truly could do, namely, either to go to meet the sword from the middle towards the hand where it has less strength, or to remain still and, while the sword swings its great arc of ten or more arms, to get underneath and strike with the point. These two ways of striking would succeed if there were men who trained quickly with the sword to strike and who alone had the courage to oppose a sword, just as the sword tries to oppose many. This would not be a miracle, for in our times, things of greater swiftness and danger are done, and indeed there are some who dare to do so with sword and buckler, but such men are not resolved to strike quickly but to receive and withstand the blow of the sword with the buckler. To strike with the sword truly requires courage and swiftness, but not that which is sought.

[5] (P224.S0)
And this shall be concerning the defense that can be given against the circular strikes made by the great sword, when one must defend oneself from many.

[6] (P224.S1)
But because it is used, and sometimes it is used, both in the lists and in some other places to fight one-on-one with a great sword, we shall still express our opinion regarding this matter.

[7] (P225.S0)
OF THE WAY TO USE THE GREAT SWORD, from one to one.

[8] (P225.S1)
TO WANT to properly use the great sword alone, it is necessary first to know how to employ it as well as the other weapons, both in the moon and in the other arms, and to be skillful in the life and strong in the arms, which is required in the handling of all weapons, and to have firmly in mind the principles of the art by which one becomes bold and resolute in all that one must do to offend and to defend oneself.

[9] (P226.S0)
One must then consider how the great sword is used today, and how it ought to be wielded.

[10] (P227.S0)
As for the first, everyone uses to thrust the points in such a way as the forehand and backhand with both hands on the sword, which method, although it is useful in cutting strikes, is harmful in thrusts for better sustaining them.

[11] (P227.S1)
Because it makes them remain much shorter than they would if they were struck well at the beginning with both hands, but then, lifting one hand from the cross and firmly holding the other from the pommel, one should then push as far as one can extend that arm, the foot, and the whole body from that side; in which manner, when drawn, if it strikes, it makes a great pass, and when it goes effectively empty, one can immediately recover, withdrawing the step and the arm, placing the other hand in its place and securing oneself in a low guard.

[12] (P227.S2)
Finding oneself therefore in high guard, which is formed with the sword either with the right side towards the enemy or with the left, in either case the arms should be held high and away from the body, ensuring that the point is somewhat bent and directed towards the ground and towards the body, so that it defends both the length of the body and also covers across the body which is too far from the sword.

[13] (P228.S0)
And if you hold the hand that is towards the enemy taken at the cross and below the hilt, and the other above and near the pommel, and standing in this manner you can strike with a thrust and with a cut.

[14] (P229.S0)
The point is then thrust once the enemy's sword has been found, as much as possible with both arms; and then, raising that of the cross, one will thrust with the hand behind as far as one can reach, always increasing the thrust with an oblique step. After delivering the strike, one will immediately withdraw that step which was increased and return the hand to the cross, and will then stop in high or low guard.

[15] (P229.S1)
Wishing then to deliver the thrust, which I do not advise as it can easily lead to being wounded beneath it, one shall first push the point with both hands, and then, taking a step forward, one shall turn the thrust, extending the arms as much as possible. With this thrust, if one finds the enemy's sword, one shall immediately withdraw the hand from the cross, and as much as one can extend it from the hilt, increasing the step and turning the hand from the hilt that holds the sword upwards to extend the point further, one shall push this point, then immediately retreat after delivering the strike in the manner described.

[16] (P230.S0)
[ 97 ] OF THE DEFENSE OF HIGH GUARD THE DEFENSE of high guard shall be the low guard, which can be formed with the right foot forward and backward, just as the high guard, which will be demonstrated in its place.

[17] (P231.S0)
Warning then to position oneself to defend in low guard, and contrary to the enemy, that is, if he is with his right foot forward, to place oneself with the left, and coming with the point or thrust, one will go to meet from outside, and suddenly finding the enemy's sword, abandoning the hand from the cross and increasing the step, will push with the hand from the pommel the point as far as it can go, which will easily wound if the enemy comes resolute to make his strike, for he will come to meet the point of the sword with that part of life that advances forward, and this shall be for the defense of the high point.

[18] (P232.S0)
The forehand can be defended if, while the enemy's sword is turning, one goes underneath in a shorter time to strike with the point, or, desiring to meet the forehand, as soon as it is encountered, to leave the hand from the cross and strike with the rising of the step as far as the hand is from the hilt.

[19] (P233.S0)
OF THE OFFENSE OF LOW GUARD.

[20] (P233.S1)
To be in the wide guard in this arduous and somewhat insecure form of arms, I shall cease to speak of it.

[21] (P233.S2)
Arriving at the low guard, which is formed in two ways, that is with the right foot or the left foot forward, in either case one can strike from the inside and from the outside. From the inside, one will do more to defend than to strike, for the enemy who is outside has too great an advantage.

[22] (P234.S0)
Finding oneself thus inside, holding the sword firmly with both hands, one shall thrust the point as far as one can extend both arms together, increasing the step and also establishing oneself in a low guard if one cannot strike.

[23] (P235.S0)
But retreating from the outside, as soon as one finds oneself with the enemy's sword, one will thrust the point with both hands as far as they can go; then, releasing the hand from the cross, increasing the step as much as one can stretch the hand from the grip, one will thrust the point, immediately withdrawing the hand and the step after the strike, reestablishing oneself anew in that low position.

[24] (P236.S0)
[ 99 ] DEFENSE OF LOW GUARD.

[25] (P236.S1)
AND IT IS A universal rule that true defense against all offenses is in the low guard; therefore, in this position, when the thrust comes from outside, it will be necessary to find oneself inside. One must do nothing other than meet the enemy's sword, pushing the arms forward to push it away from the body, while withdrawing the back foot somewhat further back in order to also withdraw the body from the offense.

[26] (P237.S0)
But when coming to the offense from within and thus finding oneself outside, as soon as one encounters the enemy's sword, one thrusts the point with both hands, raising the hand from the cross, and with the increase of the step and the hand from the pommel, one thrusts the point vigorously, which strikes securely; one must not doubt that holding the sword with one hand, one can be disarmed by the enemy, for they must retreat and defend themselves from the point, nor can one do many things at once.
