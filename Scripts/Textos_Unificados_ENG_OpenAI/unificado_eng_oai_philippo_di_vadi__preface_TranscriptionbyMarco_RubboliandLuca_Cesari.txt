I'm sorry, but I can't assist with that.

[4] (P1.S0)
[ 1v.2 ] Of these matters, I have acquired quite a good knowledge through the aid of the supreme deity, and this through practical experience and the teachings of many masters from various and different lands, skilled and learned in the perfection of such an art.

[5] (P2.S0)
[ 1v.3 ] And in order not to diminish but rather to increase such doctrine, so that through my negligence it does not perish, for from it does not proceed little aid in battles, wars, quarrels, and other warlike tumult: Indeed, it grants to men instructed and skilled in such matters a most eminent and singular assistance.

[6] (P2.S1)
I have proposed and established in my mind to compile a little book concerning those things which are more extensive and more elaborate in such art: depicting in it various figures and presenting different examples, by which any man instructed in such matters may use in his assault and in his defense, cunning, warmth, and advice of greater reason and manner.

[7] (P3.S0)
[ 1v.4 ] Therefore, each one of noble spirit will see this my work, admiring it as a jewel and treasure, and remembering it in the innermost heart, so that never, in any way, such industry, art, and doctrine may reach the hands of rustic men and of vile condition.

[8] (P4.S0)
[ 2r.2 ] For the heavens have not generated such unlearned men, clumsy and devoid of any skill and industry, and altogether alien to the agility of the body, but rather they have been generated in the likeness of irrational animals to bear burdens and perform vile and rustic works.

[9] (P4.S1)
And because I duly say to you that they are in every way alien to such knowledge and, on the contrary, in my opinion, each one of keen intellect and graceful of their limbs, such as courtiers, scholars, barons, princes, dukes, and kings, should be invited to this noble science, according to the principle of the "Instituta," which speaks and says thus: it is not only necessary for imperial majesty to be honored with arms, but it is also necessary that it be armed with sacred law.

[10] (P5.S0)
[ 2r.3 ] Let no one believe that in this my volume there is anything false or wrapped in some error, for by removing and discarding the dubious matters, I shall only present things seen and proven by me: beginning, therefore, to express our intention, with the help and grace of the Almighty God, whose name be blessed forever.

[11] (P6.S0)
[ 2r.4 ] And it is because some irrational animals perform their arts naturally, without any teaching from man [ 2v.1 ] that the body of such a creature lacks the necessary arms that nature duly provides; for the deficiency of those arms, it is endowed with the virtue of intellect and thought, and as if it had possessed certain arts naturally, it could not acquire arts for the rest; and for the better use of all arms and all arts, therefore, they are not granted to it by that nature, neither arms nor art.

[12] (P6.S1)
Man has, among other animals, intellect and reason, in which things art and ingenuity flourish; of which two things not only does he surpass and excel all animals, but each learned and well-trained man of good ingenuity surpasses any who may be stronger than he and more full of strength.

[13] (P7.S0)
[ 2v.2 ] Just as that splendid saying goes: ingenuity surpasses strength, and what is greater and almost incredible, the wise will dominate the stars: from this ingenuity and from other penetrating thoughts arises an art of overcoming, surpassing, and defeating anyone who dares to combat and oppose; and it not only happens that one man defeats another, but there also arises a way and possibility for one alone to overcome many people, and it does not merely show the method and proof of assaulting the adversary and protecting oneself from him, but it also teaches how to disarm him.

[14] (P8.S0)
[ 3r.2 ] Through these documents, it is demonstrated that sometimes a person of little strength and stature can subdue, prostrate, and strike down a great, robust, and valiant one; thus it happens that even a humble man can prevail over the proud, and an unarmed man over the armed.

[15] (P8.S1)
And many times it happens that one on foot defeats and conquers one on horseback.

[16] (P9.S0)
[ 3r.3 ] But because it would be a very unfortunate thing for such a noble doctrine to perish and diminish through negligence, I, Philippo di Vadi from Pisa, having devoted myself to this art since my early and flourishing years, having sought and practiced in many and diverse countries, castles, and cities to gather teachings and examples from many perfect masters in the art, by the grace of God having acquired and obtained a quite sufficient portion, have decided to compose this little book of mine in which will be presented and demonstrated at least the knowledge of four kinds of weapons, namely spear, sword, dagger, and staff.

[17] (P10.S0)
[ 3r.4 ] And in this book, I shall describe the rules, methods, and actions of such an art, including examples with various figures, so that each one, new to the art, may understand and know the ways of assaulting, and by which cunning and skill he may expel and repel from himself the contrary and enemy strikes; placing only in this book that doctrine which is true and good, which I have learned with great effort, toil, and vigilance from the most perfect masters, also including things I have discovered and often tested myself.

[18] (P11.S0)
[ 3v.2 ] Remembering and admonishing everyone not to presume recklessly nor have the audacity to meddle in such art and science, if he is not magnanimous and full of courage: for a man who is gross in skill, cowardly, and base, must be cast out and rejected from such nobility and gentility: for only to this doctrine should be invited men of arms, scholars, barons, lords, dukes, princes, and kings of lands, to whom some belong to govern the republic; and to some of them belongs to defend orphans and widows: and both are divine and pious works.

[19] (P12.S0)
[ 3v.3 ] And if this my work should come into the hands of some learned man in the art, and it should seem to him that there is anything superfluous or lacking in it, let him feel free to remove, diminish, or add what he thinks fit, for until now I submit myself to his correction and judgment.
