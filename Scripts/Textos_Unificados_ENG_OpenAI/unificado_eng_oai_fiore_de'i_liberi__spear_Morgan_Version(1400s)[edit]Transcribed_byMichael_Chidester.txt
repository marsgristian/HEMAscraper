================================================================================

[1] (P362.S0)
[ 9r-a ] We are three masters in guard with our lances, and when we come to take those of the sword.

[2] (P362.S1)
And I am not the first who is placed in all the iron gates to counter the thrust of the player right away.

[3] (P362.S2)
What bird flies with its right foot across the path.

[4] (P362.S3)
And he crosses through with his sword, striking in the tired parts.

[5] (P362.S4)
Thus, the passing and the rebating are done in one step with which to strike him.

[6] (P362.S5)
This thing that cannot be failed.

[7] (P363.S0)
[ 9r-b ] In the middle of the iron gate, I have positioned myself with a short spear to deflect and strike, and it is always my custom.

[8] (P363.S1)
And let come he who wants to engage with me in the art of the lance, for to parry with me, stepping aside to avoid being struck, does not diminish me.

[9] (P363.S2)
All the guards that stand off the path, with short lance and short sword, are sufficient to await any manual weapon that comes. And those on the right side cover, and with cover they pass, and they thrust.

[10] (P363.S3)
And the guards of the left side cover, or counter, and they strike fiercely and cannot be placed so well as a thrust.

[11] (P364.S0)
[ 9r-c ] I am in the noble position of the right window, ready to parry and strike always.

[12] (P364.S1)
And of the lance, I do not care much.

[13] (P364.S2)
Still with the sword, I would await the long spear, being in this guard, so that every thrust is parried and it is thwarted.

[14] (P364.S3)
And I can make the exchange of the point.

[15] (P364.S4)
And the rebating to the ground cannot be spoken of.

[16] (P364.S5)
In the game that we have before us, we wish to conclude.

[17] (P365.S0)
[ 9r-d ] In this play end the three guards that there are, all made of iron, and the middle one made of iron, and the upper one placed at the right window in which in this play they end the plays and their [!]

[18] (P365.S1)
art.

[19] (P365.S2)
As I strike this one in the face for their part.

[20] (P365.S3)
This is the contrary of the three masters of the spear who finish in this game, and I wish to speak of the manner.

[21] (P365.S4)
When the masters believe my lance is outside of their person, I strike twice with my lance and hit with the pedal.

[22] (P365.S5)
that in E thus the good Iron in the pedal that at the point, the games of these masters matter little to me.

[23] (P366.S0)
[ 9v-a ] We are three guards of the reverse side, and I am the first in the front of the zenghiar.

[24] (P366.S1)
Those guards that are on the right side do not, that which we do of the reverse.

[25] (P366.S2)
We step off the path and into the field, as it is said, off the path.

[26] (P366.S3)
And from our point of the part reversed, we make a guard.

[27] (P366.S4)
And all from the right side, and the reverse, we meet in point, parrying to finish, for no other offense can follow with the lance.

[28] (P367.S0)
[ 9v-b ] I, in the place of the true cross, I await, you have too much upon me, play cleanly.

[29] (P367.S1)
The right foot that I have given to you, I will turn it in your favor.

[30] (P367.S2)
And your lance shall be held out of the way, in the right hand straight.

[31] (P367.S3)
My point shall not fail your fallen evening.

[32] (P368.S0)
In the left window guard, I am prepared; if I do not strike you with the point, you will not escape!

[33] (P368.S1)
The good market.

[34] (P368.S2)
The point shall be held upright, and the arms shall be low, carrying the foot straight, with which I shall pass outside the line to the right side.

[35] (P368.S3)
The thrust will strike you in the face without any defense.

[36] (P368.S4)
The game that I have described, we three masters can perform it once; I will not wish to try it again.

[37] (P369.S0)
[ 9v-d ] The game of the lance ends here, for I make it from the reverse part of their plays, I become entangled.

[38] (P369.S1)
These three guards that are in this art make us think, of the high guard, or low, of not failing it, for they are guards of such great defense, that in one they make both defense and offense.

[39] (P369.S2)
And the contrary of this point, that can indeed be done.

[40] (P369.S3)
When one strikes with the point, the foot must turn to return.

[41] (P369.S4)
Of the play of the lance, this shall suffice.
