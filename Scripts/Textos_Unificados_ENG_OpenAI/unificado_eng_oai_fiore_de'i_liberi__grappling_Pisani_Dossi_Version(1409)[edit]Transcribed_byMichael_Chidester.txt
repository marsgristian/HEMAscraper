[1] (P87.S0)
[ 4a-t ] Let us begin first in the name of God and of our lord Saint George, to embrace the art of gaining the prizes.

[2] (P87.S1)
The grips are not gained if they are not with the advance, but we, the three masters, seek to show how they should be seen depicted.

[3] (P88.S0)
To gain the prizes and be well-prepared, if they do not deceive you, you will make a good market.

[4] (P89.S0)
[ 4a-b ] Of the change of the fight, I will show you how to do it, and with that I will make you give it on the ground.

[5] (P90.S0)
[ 4a-c ] If by design I do not bring you down, know that with my strength I shall do you harm and I ask.

[6] (P91.S0)
When the arms come, I will strike well prepared to gain the prizes in every way.

[7] (P92.S0)
[4b-a] When you press in this way, I will make you go, or I will displace your left arm.

[8] (P93.S0)
[ 4b-b ] With the pommel I will make you fall to the ground, O, in the key below I will make you enter.

[9] (P94.S0)
And I will make you fall to the ground on your back, and I will not let you rise without pain.

[10] (P95.S0)
[ 4b-d ] If you were a master of the embrace, I would teach you this grip in your hand.

[11] (P96.S0)
[ 4b-e ] For the grappling, I have above and you below. I will make the head in the ground be turned.

[12] (P97.S0)
[ 4b-f ] The hands at the face are well placed, so that you can show the other preparations.

[13] (P98.S0)
For the head that I have placed under your arm, I will make it go with little of my effort.

[14] (P99.S0)
[ 5a-b ] For the finger that I hold under the weary neck.

[15] (P99.S1)
I see that the grip you had was in your hand.

[16] (P100.S0)
[5a-c] You took me by great treachery, and this prey sends you into the ground, trembling.

[17] (P101.S0)
[ 5a-d ] This is a grappling of the game of barola, which does not come to be done in a single way.

[18] (P102.S0)
This is a strange and unknown cord that I can tighten without defense.

[19] (P103.S0)
In the jousts I will strike you such a blow that all your strength will be removed.

[20] (P104.S0)
In your nose I make such pain and sorrow That I would soon leave if it were your will.

[21] (P105.S0)
It is true that such a grip has left you, and with this, contrary to what was said, you will be disarmed.

[22] (P106.S0)
Under the arm, I make two and a heaviness, that in the land I will go with the back in the front.

[23] (P107.S0)
[5b-d] When you strike me in the face, you make me lose my footing, and this, contrary to the eye, makes you lose your footing even more.
