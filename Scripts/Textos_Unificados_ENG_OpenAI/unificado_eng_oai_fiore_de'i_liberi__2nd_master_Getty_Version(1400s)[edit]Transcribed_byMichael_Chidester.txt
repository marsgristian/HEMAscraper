[3] (P148.S2)

[5] (P149.S0)
[ 13r-c ] ¶ The opposite of the King who crosses in front, I make it so that with his crossing he will not make me take a step, for such a blow I shall give to the hilt, that I will make him turn, and I will strike him immediately.

[6] (P150.S0)

[7] (P150.S1)

[11] (P151.S0)

[12] (P151.S1)
And if I say that I break with this hold all his four plays mentioned before.

[13] (P151.S2)
And I cannot see that I do not throw him to the ground, for the grip that I have is strong and fierce.
