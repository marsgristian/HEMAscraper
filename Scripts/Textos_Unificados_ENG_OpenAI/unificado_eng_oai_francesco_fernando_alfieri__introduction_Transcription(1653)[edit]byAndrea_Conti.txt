[14] (P56.S3)
MDCLIII.

[15] (P56.S4)
With the permission of the superiors.

[16] (P57.S0)
To the Most Illustrious Lord, and Most Reverend Master, THE SIGNOR.

[17] (P57.S1)
MARTINO VIDMAN Count of Ortenburgh, Baron of San Paterniano, and Sumereg, etc. As the most devoted servant of Your Excellency.

[18] (P57.S2)
Most Illustrious, I have been continually pondering how I might most worthily show some sign of my devotion to the greatness of Your Name; having the persuasion and the utility of learned Knights to once again bring to light the long parts of my labors, I was considering within myself to whom noble and authoritative name I should offer and commend them, especially knowing how often the actions of others, virtuous though they may be, are valued in these times when they are not supported by a notable subject and protected by its safeguarding Clemency; I called upon my fortunate Fate to present to Your Excellency.

[19] (P57.S3)
Most Illustrious, I present to you these knightly exercises of skillfully handling the sword, with which the orders of chivalry are conferred, and every dispute is settled; the reverence I hold for the infinite merits of Your Excellency.

[20] (P57.S4)
Most Illustrious, you have led me to dedicate this work to the immortality of your glorious name.

[21] (P57.S5)
I do not consider it at all unbecoming of his high condition, since being skilled in Letters and Arms of exquisite valor and singular quality, and as a type of heroic achievements, he certainly could not find a Lord (I do not know if I should call him so) of greater or better worth, where so many excellent prerogatives of Nobility, learning, and splendor shine forth in competition, as he governs his vassals with his supreme authority in the domain of Ortemburgh, his most noble County of the Empire in Carinthia; I leave aside the countless dignities of his most noble Brothers, both of the Eminent Cardinal and of the Illustrious, Excellent Count David, General of Battle for the Apostolic Faith, and of the Illustrious Lord Count Ludovico, who, with his Majestic presence, embodies a Hero, and all united sit upon the wings of Fame, celebrated in part by illustrious writers, are rather to be admired than narrated.

[22] (P57.S6)
It would be easier to count the rays of the Sun than to mention them one by one.

[23] (P57.S7)
It is enough to merely hint that Your Excellency.

[24] (P57.S8)
Most Illustrious.

[25] (P57.S9)
He is loved by the great, honored by the greater, and revered by all, and his glories are boundless; But in which sea shall I place my tongue?

[26] (P57.S10)
if it is a fifth essence of the most refined, and pure qualities adorned with those titles that admit no end; these remarkable conditions are more subjects of a long History than of a simple Letter expressive of a reverent spirit; Meanwhile, I accept Your Excellency.

[27] (P57.S11)
Most Illustrious, my small tribute, a testimony of fervent devotion, with which I humbly bow to you, wishing for the fulfillment of your lofty thoughts.

[28] (P57.S12)
Of Padua the 10th.

[29] (P57.S13)

[30] (P57.S14)
Of Your Excellency.

[31] (P57.S15)
Most Illustrious Most Humble Servant Francesco Alfieri.

[32] (P58.S0)
[ viii ] TO THE LORD FRANCESCO ALFIERI Master of Arms of the Illustrious Academy of Delia in Padua.

[33] (P58.S1)
OF ANTONIO MONTEROSSO.

[34] (P58.S2)
If the pen, or the sword, ingenuity, or art brings greater splendor to you FRANCESCO, I am not Paris, I am, that lively and strong, you have in mind Apollo, and in the hand Mars.

[35] (P58.S3)
You Writer, and Warrior, apart and apart, Spread and defend against Time and Death Your Fame and Honor, mixed consort, In the Undertakings of Arms and of Letters.

[36] (P58.S4)
You of the Ball, the valor of Hercules the Shield (Gifts, which Nature denies to so many) Hold with a lively mind, and a firm arm.

[37] (P58.S5)
In summary, your power in the world is revealed, That you are in the lists, and in the public and solitary school, Of the rare Fencers ALPHA, & OMEGA.

[38] (P59.S0)
[ ix ] TO THE SAME.

[39] (P59.S1)
The same.

[40] (P59.S2)
O Celestial Maravilha, Foi quem da ferida criminosa Retornou à vida: Mas, maior milagre, Tu, o Alfieri com a Arte, Salvas vidas a tantos industriosos Marte, Com a espada e a tinta, Sem sangue reparas nossa vida.

[41] (P59.S3)
You of the Sword honor, and of the arms more beautiful, illustrious boast Alfieri, possess as much as the Lady grants to the human Warrior Lord.

[42] (P59.S4)
In this our century, I show you the proud monster of Bellona, Master, you shine in worthy Art, striving to live against immortal death.

[43] (P60.S0)
TO THE AUTHOR I The Book of Arms, so well woven, Lord Francesco, it has been a great pleasure for me to read, admiring in it your doctrine, which indeed shows itself to be a subtle distillation, extracted from the singular vivacity of your spirit, and for being such worthy material, it shall be received with much satisfaction by the scholarly knights, and I certify to Your Serenity.

[44] (P60.S1)
that will give the World a testament of his Noble genius, and it shall not be less worthy of praise than deserving of every honor, and it will remain, Your Excellency.

[45] (P60.S2)
To the World for immortal fame, in such a way that it will live forever in the mouths of noble Knights, after the passage of this mortal life; the said Work cannot be harmed by a cursed tongue, carrying with it the imprint of Arms to strike; it is the tongue messenger of the heart to defend its reasons, such that there can be no fear of the charlatans, remaining entangled in the labyrinth of malediction, with mockery and dishonor, with which I conclude my kiss to Your Excellency.

[46] (P60.S3)
the hands, and I wish them every good from Heaven.

[47] (P60.S4)
Of the Academy on the 20th.

[49] (P60.S6)
Served with heart, The Incognito Academic.

[50] (P61.S0)
[ xi ] TO THE READER.

[51] (P61.S1)
THE READER; I finally present to you my Fencing; the thought I have had is to teach you to understand this Art; if you know it, I do not speak with you, if you do not know it, you cannot blame me; I well know that pleasing in these times is a very difficult matter, the desire to benefit you has made me set aside all respect; Infinite is the number of Fencers, few are the good ones, and all believe themselves to be the best; with long experience, I bring you again a Guard not thought of by others, and of all the most perfect for defense and for striking; there is nothing that can be imagined, and occur around the thrusts, the cuts, and all the other circumstances to remain superior in duels, that has not been clearly demonstrated to you by me; if I may implore two hours of your courtesy, read the whole Book, and if afterwards you regret having lost time, think of what I have lost for you, and you will be consoled.
