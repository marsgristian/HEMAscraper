[1] (P174.S0)
[10a-e] I want that anyone who knows my master understands that for the sake of defense, there is no one who can match me. For the wound that I inflict upon your elbow will make your arm dislocate very quickly.

[3] (P176.S0)
[ 16b-c ] If I wish to disengage this spear from her, I must deliver a great blow upon her, so that I may break your lance in two, and I shall desire to come to the streets.

[7] (P180.S0)
For the way that I hold you and take you, with the shoulders on the ground, I will go stretched out.

[8] (P181.S0)
For your dagger, such a cover I make, and with other plays, I shall make you a master.

[9] (P182.S0)
If I can turn this your arm, I will make you enter into the key of the cassock.

[10] (P183.S0)
[ 11a-b ] If from below, or from above you set yourself to draw the dagger for this crossing

[11] (P184.S0)
[ 11a-c ] For your arm that I hold with two hands.

[12] (P184.S1)
Of the hand, I hold the dagger with you and worthy.

[13] (P185.S0)
[ 11a-d ] The scholar who gives in does not play his game, and to take the dagger, I show it in his place.
