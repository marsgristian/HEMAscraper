[16] OF THE GUARD AND THE GUARD POSITIONS in arms are sites or positions such that they ward off enemy offenses, and they are like a shield and a wall; therefore, whoever does not know how to properly gather the guard and hold the arms in such a way that they either cover or can easily cover the entire body cannot be said to be in guard. Great diligence must therefore be placed in adjusting the guard and the arms, so that one is secure, as one must at times rest in it to take a new position, or to wait for the enemy to present an opportunity to engage.

[2] (P54.S0)
What they can use in the single sword are three; nor can there be, to my knowledge, more than these, since it is not possible in any other way with a single straight line, which is the sword, to cover and defend oneself, and easily to offend.

[3] (P55.S0)
OF THE HIGH GUARD

This high guard, which could likewise be called first, for it is the one that forms the man in drawing the sword from the scabbard, can be called a guard in as much as, by turning the point of the sword downwards, it threatens the whole person; and also because, by gathering the left foot back, one can, with the rising of the right, deliver a great thrust to the enemy.

[4] (P56.S0)
[ 20 ] OF THE LOW GUARD.

[5] (P56.S1)
Q VESTA still demands a low effect, nor does it perhaps displease the name given to it by: all the masters of this art, since it is so strong, secure, and convenient that there is none other in which a man can more easily offend and defend, and in which he can stand with less effort. This is formed in different ways by the schools; that is to say, either by holding the hand low before the knee, or very extended forward, or between one knee and the other, which all these methods, if we consider the reason of nature and motion, are somewhat unsuitable, because besides being all violent, thus one can endure little in them, they are also such that one cannot strike except in two times, or in one with little force. Therefore, leaving all those aside, we shall form one that will be suited to the time, to nature, and to safety; which will be to hold the arm straight down along the knee but outside the way, and the sword somewhat with the point raised and towards the left side, so that it can both arm and defend in such a way that the arm is kept free from violence, allowing one to endure much.

[6] (P56.S2)
When wishing to strike, one can at the same time thrust with a great point, which does not yield while keeping the arm forward; in which case, either you must withdraw the arm to strike, or strike very weakly at the same time.

[7] (P57.S0)
[ 21 ] OF THE WAY TO STRIKE.

[8] (P57.S1)
Without any doubt, the thrust must be preferred to the cut, both because it strikes in less time and also because, by striking in less time, it causes greater harm.

[9] (P57.S2)
for which reason the Romans who were victorious in all their endeavors.

[10] (P57.S3)
They accustomed their soldiers of the legions to strike only with the point; arguing in their reasoning that few are the cuts that kill, although great, and the points, though small, when they enter a body three fingers deep, most often tend to kill.

[11] (P57.S4)
There shall therefore be a firm and unchangeable rule that to thrust is whenever one finds oneself with it against the enemy, to strike more swiftly and deliver a greater blow.

[12] (P57.S5)
And in this thrusting to strike with greater fury than one can and with greater advantage and longer.

[13] (P57.S6)
One must always be aware to turn the left foot towards the back, so that the rear foot always turns to remain in a straight line with the hand and the sword, like the diameter of a circle, due to the turning of the circle.

[14] (P57.S7)
And in finishing the strike, draw back the rear foot half a step forward; in this way, the strike becomes longer and stronger, and it does not expose the shoulder and the side to the enemy, thus keeping them at a distance where they cannot harm you, for it is not possible to make a longer thrust than this.

[15] (P58.S0)
Where it is much better, to let the sword go towards that part where the enemy strikes it and to add that fury that can assist that motion, and by making a circle, to strike with the edge.

[16] (P59.S0)
The blow is so swift and strong that the enemy hardly finds the time to defend against it, for he has already been occupied in striking the sword, and in wanting to then strike, not expecting the enemy's sword to be so swift or cutting towards that part.

[17] (P60.S0)
[ 24 ] OF THE WAYS OF DEFENDING.

[18] (P60.S1)
The methods of defending against a cutting and thrusting attack are three: the first, by opposing the weapon to the offense, in such a way that the weapon coming to strike the head or the body cannot reach the place where it is aimed, and is found impeded by something that at that moment has been opposed to it, whether it be a sword, dagger, buckler, halberd, spear, or anything else that one might have at hand in that situation, for it does not always happen to have specific weapons prepared for such an effect, nor would it be fitting for a Soldier or a Knight to not know how to offend or defend except with weapons specifically made for that need.

[19] (P60.S2)
Where it could be said that the Soldier is not different from other men for knowing better how to wield the sword or the halberd, but for knowing in every occasion how to better recognize the advantage and with judgment to know how to defend himself with whatever he desires, and surely to offend, for true fencing does not consist in anything else.

[20] (P61.S0)
And he who thinks he can grasp this art by practicing many particular thrusts and cuts is mistaken.

[21] (P61.S1)
Since, besides these particular things, little knowledge is gained, the Accidents in this art are so many and diverse that it is not possible to make a decision immediately, without having a universal understanding of all the warnings and principles of the art, which are founded solely upon offense and defense, and not upon the sword alone, dagger, shield, buckler, spear, and halberd. For it is not always that one must offend or defend with these weapons, but at times it will be necessary to defend oneself with a stick against a spear, with a stool against a sword, and with a cloak against a dagger. In such cases, many other direct reversals are not employed for defense, but one acts according to what the natural instinct provides at that moment, which instinct is nothing other than the knowledge of the given warnings. This knowledge, being naturally in the soul, requires that it be somewhat aided and habituated by the art, thus making a man secure and bold enough to dare to enter into every great peril, and he knows, as he sees the quality of the weapon and the position in which it is, what it can do and in how many ways it can offend and defend. From this judgment arises the knowledge of what one should do and how one should act against it.

[22] (P62.S0)
But returning to the matter of the way to defend, which is to oppose the weapon, this is commonly used by the vulgar, but not useful in the manner that the cause requires; for when they come to meet and oppose the weapon that comes to offend, not trusting that the weapon can defend, nor knowing how it can defend, they withdraw together with the foot, and they make all these errors;

[23] (P63.S0)
Before withdrawing, they come to meet the enemy's sword towards the point where it has more strength, and therefore it is difficult to withstand that blow.

[24] (P64.S0)
The other thing is that when one wishes to strike the enemy, it is necessary to return the feet and the arms to where they were before and to advance even further, if one wishes to strike the enemy vigorously; and here so much time is consumed that anyone can not only easily defend themselves but can also comfortably and safely offend during this time.

[25] (P65.S0)
Therefore, one must use this method of defense surely when one goes to meet the enemy's sword, not to withdraw, but to take a diagonal step with the left foot so that it meets the sword coming in a cutting manner, in the part that offends less strongly, from whence the blow is easily parried; and coming in with the point, one goes to find and push the enemy's sword in a way that any slight movement is enough to distance the point from the offense. This applies both in the cutting blow and in the thrust, as it helps to evade the life from the straight line where one is wounded and finds oneself too close and convenient for the enemy to offend, that almost instantly one is wounded, and the enemy cannot withdraw enough to avoid the offense. Therefore, one has the straight step of the right foot to follow, which step is so strong and swift that the enemy cannot evade it, and this method of defense seems to me more secure and briefer than any other.

[26] (P66.S0)
Another way is when, noticing that the enemy's sword, intending to strike with the edge, makes a wide arc before the sword falls, one wounds the enemy with the point; or when one intends to strike with the point, in many instances, likewise in a shorter time one can wound. This method of defense is most useful and perhaps the best, for there is no one who comes rushing to engage in arms and, feeling themselves wounded, does not immediately retreat, holding back every blow they had already prepared to unleash. And although some find themselves, when wounded, running recklessly about, this happens only shortly after they have been struck, when anger seizes them; but in that instant that they are wounded, all recoil and are dismayed, and from the blood that flows, they weaken more and more.

[27] (P67.S0)
Whereafter one has wounded him, it is useful to remain on guard, and not to lose heart due to the fury of the wounded, but to stay in the mind that he will return to strike in many inconveniences that arise from his anger.

[28] (P68.S0)
The third way is fleeing by moving out of the straight line toward one side or the other, but this method is rarely used alone; rather, it is accompanied by opposing the weapon or with the second. And if it is used alone, it is done by allowing the blow to pass empty and then striking the enemy at the moment they are carried away by the blow.

[29] (P69.S0)
[28] OF THE MANNER IN WHICH ONE SHALL HANDLE THE FOLLOWING HEADINGS.

[30] (P69.S1)
In the following chapters, I shall come to a more particular teaching, and instruct on the offenses and defenses in every guard, so that no one may marvel, not wishing to note every particular strike in every guard regarding offenses and defenses.

[31] (P69.S2)
And therefore we believe that the doctrine is truncated and lacking, we seem to say that having the intention to speak only of what pertains for now to the true art, in which thrusts are more suitable for it as they are swifter and stronger, we shall mainly discuss them, not failing to also speak of cuts when we are in a place where cutting strikes may be advantageous, and to place alongside them their defenses, although for all cutting strikes that defense of striking in a straight line is excellent before the sword falls, because by going in a shorter time, the fall is avoided.

[32] (P69.S3)
The order, therefore, that we shall maintain will be for each guard, its offenses and defenses of the thrusts primarily, and then of the cuts if there be need.

[33] (P70.S0)
OF THE OFFENSE OF HIGH GUARD with the sword alone.

[34] (P70.S1)
The true and certain strike that can be delivered while retreating into high guard is the thrust; for it is of a straight line, and it naturally comes to rest in low guard, in such a way that from the beginning to the end of this strike, one never gives the enemy time to enter, as one always keeps the point towards him, but in the act of delivering.

[35] (P70.S2)
This strike, one should first avert by withdrawing the weary foot behind the right and then let it go with the advance of the right foot with as much fury as one can, establishing oneself in the low guard.

[36] (P71.S0)
Well, indeed, it is possible to strike a direct and reverse blow to the head, or even downward to the hand's knot, but one cannot turn the wrist so little to deliver a cut, whether high or low, without allowing the point of the sword to stray from the straight line of a sword's length, during which time the enemy is given the opportunity to strike; therefore, I would not advise anyone to use them.

[37] (P71.S1)
Only [30] they both together, but if well between two thrusts they continue one behind the other until the last thrust, which is then secured in a low guard.

[38] (P71.S2)
The way to use them is this.

[39] (P72.S0)
When finding oneself having thrust the high guard point without offense, as it has been defended by the enemy's sword, one must immediately turn the right hand of the hilt across the head, slightly turning the back foot to the right to extend that cut further, which by its nature is more dangerous than any other strike.

[40] (P72.S1)
And if the enemy defends against this, which is quite difficult, one must immediately turn the reverse of the strike, stepping back with the rear foot at an oblique angle.

[41] (P72.S2)
And it is to be noted that one should always almost use this oblique step when executing the reverse strike, in order to exit the straight line in which one can easily be wounded while delivering a reverse. Therefore, having made this step and executed the reverse, whether it connects or not, one must immediately withdraw the sword somewhat, which withdrawal serves to be useful, as it can, with the reverse strike, sever and cause a great wound. Hence, it should be understood that all cutting strikes should be delivered in such a way that they sever.

[42] (P73.S0)
Therefore, for the right, little force is needed; thus, I say that as soon as the sword is withdrawn, one should with the straight step of the right foot deliver the low thrust already prepared, which is so strong and due to its convenience and elevation that it would break through any obstruction.

[43] (P73.S1)
And all these strikes, starting from the high thrust down to the low thrust, being delivered one after the other with that swiftness which is required, are almost irreparable; and in them there is such an increase that it is hardly possible for any man to withdraw as much as these advance forward.

[44] (P74.S0)
OF THE OFFENSE OF HIGH GUARD high guard.

[45] (P74.S1)
The fury of striking, as previously mentioned, will be nothing and vain when, in the manner shown here, one goes to parry and meet the first thrust. For this, it is necessary to find oneself in a low guard, and as the thrust comes, to meet it from the outside, simultaneously advancing with the back foot in an oblique step, by which one moves out of the straight line and passes to the right side of the enemy. One must always be careful to keep the point of the sword directed towards the enemy, so that, by advancing, they may injure themselves, which often easily occurs, especially when they come resolutely to strike; or, if they do not advance so far as to meet the sword, they may be safely struck by the increase of the straight step, to which the oblique step must be resolved immediately. Even if the enemy remains in the initial advance, they may be wounded, for that wound, not striking the eye, will be of little importance. However, as soon as the oblique step is taken, one will advance with the other straight step, which grows so close to the enemy that, as one passes, it will drive the sword into their chest up to the hilt.

[46] (P75.S0)
As for the direct and reverse thrusts, to defend against these, the warnings that the cutting blow makes the round, and that the shorter point, with that which is closer, reaches sooner should suffice; and therefore, to strike with the point beneath those cutting blows, it is also natural to defend oneself in another way. I say that one can meet the direct thrust with the blade by pushing while at the same time directing the point towards the face, slightly turning the back foot to the rear on the right side to extend the point further and to be more covered behind the sword.

[47] (P76.S0)
And this way of defending is suitable for all high strikes, because this is the best of all for such a reason that it not only defends but at the same time wounds and secures.

[48] (P77.S0)
This kind of defense is called reversed point.

[49] (P77.S1)
Wishing to parry the thrust, one shall oppose it, even with the cut from the outside, and shall increase the oblique step, then striking with the point prepared by the increase of the straight step; and this method shall also be said for all that can be used to defend against a high thrust when wishing to oppose the sword, and this is the same method that is also used to defend against the point.

[50] (P78.S0)
OF THE OFFENSE OF WIDE GUARD.

[51] (P78.S1)
THE TRUE main and most secure strike that can be used in this guard; is the thrust, drawing first the weary foot close to the right.

[52] (P78.S2)
And then drawing it with the increased strength of the right hand; establishing oneself in the low guard,

[53] (P79.S0)
One could also, in this guard with the aforementioned foot raised, draw a straight thrust while still affirming oneself in the low guard.

[54] (P79.S1)
And it could be done, although with great discomfort, to draw a reversal.

[55] (P79.S2)
Nothing [33] less, to stray too far from the straight line in which one can strike surely, does not seem to me that it should be used, and perhaps even little the forehand, for the same reason.

[56] (P79.S3)
Therefore, one should secure oneself only at the point, which should not be drawn unless great convenience or necessity compels me to do so; since it can not only be easily repaired, but one can also be wounded beneath it almost as securely, as will be shown in the defense.

[57] (P79.S4)
Therefore, what can be done most securely when found in this guard is to await the enemy.

[58] (P80.S0)
THE DEFENSE OF WIDE GUARD.

[59] (P80.S1)
To defend oneself from the strikes that come from the aforementioned wide guard, it is good to withdraw against a low guard; for being opposed in the same guard does not provide ease of entry and is very inconvenient for defense. Hence, by retreating into a low guard, one can easily and conveniently parry the thrust and counter with a push, so that one will reach first. And wishing only to oppose the sword and not to strike below, one must meet the enemy's sword with the edge, then quickly strike back at the enemy's face. With this, by turning the hand and the edge, it will be good to advance the foot forward in a half-oblique step to the right, establishing oneself in a wide guard.

[60] (P80.S2)
In the defense of the reverse, one must be alert when the enemy raises the point of the sword from the straight line, for it is likely that he will turn it, and at that moment, with the left hand making a straight step, one must seize the hand of the enemy with the sword, and strike him at the same time with a thrust from below already prepared for the defense against the thrust.

[61] (P81.S0)
One must use the same defense as is done in the straight; in this, there is another difference, except that under the straight one can, in the time of the turn, thrust the point and reach first, whereas the thrust of necessity must be parried, because coming in a straight line does not offer advantage or time to reach first.

[62] (P82.S0)
OF THE OFFENSE OF LOW GUARD.

[63] (P82.S1)
IN THIS guard, just as in the others, one may strike with the point, with the direct and reverse cut; but the true and principal effect of it is to await the enemy, both because one can hold oneself in this position without tiring, and because it is very suitable to swiftly defend against all strikes, whether high or low.

[64] (P82.S2)
Since being in the middle, one can easily raise oneself a little and lower oneself somewhat.

[65] (P82.S3)
Therefore, if someone finds themselves in this guard, they should not, for their own advantage, be the first to strike with a thrust or a reverse, for departing from the straight line can be a cause of death, giving the enemy time to quickly enter with a point.

[66] (P82.S4)
The sole point can be used wanting to be the first to strike, and it can be drawn either in or out.

[67] (P82.S5)
However, warning in both ways to have the arm situated in such a manner.

[68] (P82.S6)
That it is not necessary before one thrusts to withdraw it, and coming with this point covered from the enemy with the sword across, as some are wont to do.

[69] (P82.S7)
Then one must take a step forward and raise the hand from the sword, directing the point downward between the sword and the life of the enemy, pushing the point with the advancement of the straight step of the right foot; and this point can easily wound because it is advancing and continuously in a straight line, such that the enemy can do nothing but retreat, especially when he is struck from the outside, finding himself in such a way that the sword is secure from the side.

[70] (P83.S0)
DEFENSE OF LOW GUARD.

[71] (P83.S1)
Being the most certain and effective defense of the right and reverse of this guard, I will not spend time on anything else for now, confining myself only to the point, which, if not properly addressed at the beginning, can be the cause of death.

[72] (P83.S2)
Therefore, when this thrust from within is executed, it must be parried with the edge from the inside, and this is called a turning of the hand inward, rotating the back foot to the right as much as the left hand turns. And once the enemy's sword is found and pushed, the hand must be turned and cut from the reverse towards the face, always bringing the front foot forward in the direction where the hand is.

[73] (P83.S3)
If now this thrust comes from the outside, it is necessary to push it with the edge and turn the hand outward, simultaneously taking an oblique step, by which you evade the attack, and while advancing the other step straight, pushing the prepared point, you go to strike the enemy.

[74] (P84.S0)
If the End of the Sole Sword.
