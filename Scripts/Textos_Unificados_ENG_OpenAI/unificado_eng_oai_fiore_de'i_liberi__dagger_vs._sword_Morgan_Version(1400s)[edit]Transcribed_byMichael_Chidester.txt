[1] (P214.S0)
[ 18r-d ] Here begins the play of sword and dagger; the advantage is great to those who know how to do it.

[2] (P214.S1)
The master waits in this guard with the dagger.

[3] (P214.S2)
And this guard is called the tooth of the boar, for it receives cuts and thrusts, and from those I guard myself, I will strike with the right hand, with the counter to make it return.

[4] (P214.S3)
The close play is only in the mind, and I cannot speak of it.

[5] (P214.S4)
Let him come one by one who wishes to fight against me, for if he does not, I shall not flee from him.

[6] (P214.S5)
I spoil it in a turn.

[7] (P215.S0)
[ 18v-a ] My master against the point makes such a cover and suddenly strikes to the face or to the chest.

[8] (P215.S1)
And with the dagger, against the sword, one should always desire close play.

[9] (P215.S2)
Here I am close, and I can strike you well.

[10] (P215.S3)
Either you or you must endure it.

[11] (P216.S0)
[ 18v-b ] If the player who has denounced me had known how to make such a defense.

[12] (P216.S1)
If he had the hand in such a way as to place it on the student, in this manner, straight to his elbow, turning it in such a way that it is shown here.

[13] (P216.S2)
I did not need to act contrary to the master who stands with the dagger in position.

[14] (P217.S0)
[ 18v-c ] If the master who is in guard with the dagger against the sword receives a downward strike to the head.

[15] (P217.S1)
He passes in front, and this cover he makes to be ready and from the turn thinking of the elbow.

[16] (P217.S2)
And that can strike well suddenly.

[17] (P217.S3)
Still, the sword can be bound with the arm, in such a way that the fourth play of the one-handed sword can do, and also in the dagger you will find that middle binding in the third play.

[18] (P217.S4)
That after the turn is a span away.

[19] (P219.S0)
[ 18v-d ] This is a technique of dagger against the sword. He who has a dagger and holds that of the sword by the hilt, I say to you, I will strike you with my dagger before you draw the sword from the scabbard.

[20] (P219.S1)
What of the sword I shall say, since I am prepared.

[21] (P219.S2)
And as for that of the sword, it is according to what is depicted here above.

[22] (P220.S0)
[ 17r-a ] When he raises his arm to strike me with the dagger.

[23] (P220.S1)
Immediately I have placed him!

[24] (P220.S2)
the dagger resting against his arm in such a way that he cannot make a move.

[25] (P220.S3)
And immediately I unsheathe my sword, and if I can strike him before he can touch me with his dagger.

[26] (P220.S4)
I could also take the dagger from the hand in the manner that the first master of the dagger does.

[27] (P220.S5)
I could still bind it in the middle bind, for it is the third.

[28] (P220.S6)
Game of the dagger, of the first master who is remedy.
