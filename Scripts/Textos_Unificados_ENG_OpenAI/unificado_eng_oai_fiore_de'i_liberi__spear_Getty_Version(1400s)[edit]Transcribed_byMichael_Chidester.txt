[1] (P362.S0)
[ 39r-a ] ¶ We are three Masters in guard with our Lances, and we agree to take those of the sword.

[2] (P362.S1)
And I am the first who, in all the iron gate, am placed to parry the lance of the player immediately, that is, who passes with the right foot to the cross out of the way, and crossing his lance, I parry it to the weary part.

[3] (P362.S2)
So that the passing and the parrying is done in a step with which I strike him.

[4] (P362.S3)
This is a thing that cannot be failed.

[5] (P363.S0)
In the middle of the Iron Gate, I place myself with the lance, to parry and to strike, and it is always my custom.

[6] (P363.S1)
And let him come who wishes with a half lance or staff, for to parry with my step the blow does not stain my hand.

[7] (P363.S2)
That all the guards that stand outside the path, with short lance and short sword, are sufficient to await every long manual weapon.

[8] (P363.S3)
And those of the right part cover and with cover pass and they put the point.

[9] (P363.S4)
And the guards of the left side cover and parry and strike fiercely, and cannot be placed so well as to point.

[10] (P364.S0)
[ 39v-a ] ¶ I am the noble position of the Right Window, where I am always ready to parry and strike.

[11] (P364.S1)
and I take care of the long spear little.

[12] (P364.S2)
Still with the sword, I would await the long spear, standing in this guard that deflects every thrust, and if it delays.

[13] (P364.S3)
And I can make the exchange of the point.

[14] (P364.S4)
And to strike the ground 
one cannot fail, In the play that we wish 
to conclude.

[15] (P365.S0)
[ 39v-c ] ¶ In this play, the three guards that are in it finish, namely, all iron guard, and iron guard The middle, and guard!

[16] (P365.S1)
from the window The upper right.

[17] (P365.S2)
In this game, they finish the plays and their art.

[18] (P365.S3)
As I strike this one for their part.

[19] (P366.S0)
[ 40r-a ] ¶ We are three guards of the opposite side, and I am the first in the teeth of the tiger.

[20] (P366.S1)
Those who are on the right side do what we do from the reverse.

[21] (P366.S2)
We pass off the road ahead, advancing the foot that is before, as said, off the road.

[22] (P366.S3)
And from our points of the reversed part, we make a parry.

[23] (P366.S4)
And all to the right side  
and reverse we come together at the point, striking to finish, for  
no other offense with the lance can follow.

[24] (P367.S0)
In the guard of the true cross, I await.

[25] (P367.S1)
You are too close to me, play clean.

[26] (P367.S2)
The right foot that is before me, I will turn it, and your lance I will deflect off the path, towards the right hand; my point will not miss, yours shall miss.

[27] (P368.S0)
In the guard of the left window, I am prepared,  
If I do not strike you with my point, you will not escape!

[28] (P368.S1)
good trade.

[29] (P368.S2)
The point holds high and the arms low, I will carry it with my foot that is straight, with that I will pass outside of the path with my hand reversed. The point will be placed in your face without any defense.

[30] (P368.S3)
The play that I have before me, we three Masters can perform it.

[31] (P368.S4)
If I try it once, I will not want to try it again.

[32] (P369.S0)
[ 40r-d ] ¶ The play of the lance ends here, as I demonstrate it from the reverse side of the plays.

[33] (P369.S1)
These three guards that are before make thought of the long spear, or short, do not fail it, for they are a guard of great defense that in one passage they make offense and defense.

[34] (P369.S2)
And against this point, it can indeed be done well, when the point breaks, the pedal must be turned, and with that strike of the game of the lance, this can suffice.
