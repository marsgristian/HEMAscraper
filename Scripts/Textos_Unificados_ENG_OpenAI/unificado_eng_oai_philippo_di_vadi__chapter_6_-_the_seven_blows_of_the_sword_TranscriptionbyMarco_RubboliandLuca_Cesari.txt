[1] (P18.S0)
[ 9r.3 ] The seven strikes of the sword.

[2] (P18.S1)
Chapter VI.

[3] (P18.S2)
If we strike and make cuts often with effort,  
Head and teeth with rightful reason,  
And every guard that is made earthly,  
We often break with our ingenuity,  
Passing one and the other without effort.  
With the blade, we make a bloody sign,  
If we mix ourselves with the wheel.  
All the art shall be our support.  
In striking, we give ourselves a gift,  
We return to guard again from opening to opening.  
We are not slow to strike; here take note.

[4] (P18.S3)
I am the wheel and I hold in me such a burden, If with other strikes I wish to mingle: I will often place the point to the bow. Loyalty and courtesy I cannot use, Turning step for straight downward strikes, And I ruin arms and hands without delay. The people call me by name, I seek the falsehood of the sword. Whoever employs me sharpens his mind.

[5] (P18.S4)
If we are flying always crossing and from the knee upwards our strike, cutting and thrusting often gives a signal. For across us it passes without failing, the wheel that strikes from below upwards and with the cut warms our cheeks.
