Of the second part, being you patient and the enemy acting.

[5] (P71.S3)
Being left with your sword in a high and long tail and your dagger as I have told you above, and if your enemy strikes you with a downward thrust to the head, you will strongly thrust your right foot forward and parry that blow with your sword, and with your dagger, you will thrust a point at his sides. And when you take that position, ensure that the hand of your sword is well extended and the point is directed towards the ground; and for your defense, you will deliver a downward diagonal strike, with your right leg retreating to the left, so that your sword will be lowered in a high guard and your dagger will be in a high guard as well; and if in such a stance your enemy strikes you with any blow, from above or below, you will step with your right foot towards the weak side of the enemy and thus counter with a false strike to his blow and then deliver a reverse strike to his leg; and at the same time, for your defense, you will deliver a false straight strike from below upwards, retreating with your right foot behind, towards his hands, in such a way that you will make a half turn of the fist with both hands and your sword will be in a high and long tail and your dagger will be in a high iron guard, and there you will stand with your arms well extended.

Of the third part: rule for driving out the enemy.

[9] (P72.S3)
Being you with your sword in a long and high guard and your dagger in iron guard, from here I want you to thrust at your enemy with a thrust to make him retreat.

[10] (P72.S4)
But let us suppose that he did not wish to strike any blow; then you will place your right foot opposite his weary side, and you will deliver a false straight thrust from below upwards towards his dagger hand, in such a way that your sword will remain in a long and narrow tail, and your dagger will be in high guard; then, if your enemy were to strike you with a straight thrust, or a reverse, to the head or to the leg, or with a thrust to the face, against all these strikes you will respond with a crossed straight thrust, with your right leg retreating sideways, so that your sword will be lowered in a narrow iron door position and your dagger will be in high guard; and if then your enemy were to respond with any blow, you will step forward with your right foot and strike with a false thrust from below upwards against the blow he delivers, with a cut straight thrust that will stop in a narrow iron door position, and your dagger will go into high guard, with your arms extended towards the enemy's right; and here you will remain in this guard.

[13] (P73.S2)
Fourth part: the way to make the enemy strike.

[14] (P73.S3)
You know that in the third part previously, you are with the sword remaining in the tight iron guard and your dagger in the high guard, but from here I want you to use this term, that is, you will make one foot push the other, especially the left will push the right forward, nevertheless striking with a false cut and slicing with a true cut either to the leg or to the arms or to the face; and this is called raising and pulling, so that by doing this, he will be compelled to strike some blow, either from below or from above; let us suppose that he strikes from above with a downward cut or with a round forehand to the face or with a crooked forehand: in each of these forehands, you will throw your right foot a little towards his right side and in such a throw you will parry his blow in the face guard with the point of your sword towards the right side of your enemy's face; at the same time, you will step with the left and strike him with a forehand with the dagger and a backhand with the sword, so that your sword will land in a long and extended tail and the left leg will be forward and your dagger will remain in a high iron guard, well polished and elegant.

[15] (P73.S4)
And here you will fix your gaze on both hands of your aforementioned enemy, for it is necessary that on the other side you grip him tightly, so that he is forced to come out either point or straight or crooked, thus pay close attention.

[18] (P74.S2)
Of the fifth part: to give weariness to the enemy.

[19] (P74.S3)
Now, having remained in the fourth part with your sword in a long and extended guard and your dagger in a narrow iron port, it is necessary for you to maintain this order, that is, to engage him with a feint using either the dagger or the sword, and he, due to the opening you will create, will be compelled to strike at you. And know that when you make such a feint, the right foot will push forward the left, so that by keeping this order, he will be forced to commit to something.

[20] (P74.S4)
Now, when he attacks you from the right with a thrust to the leg or to the head, or with a stab, at such a time that he strikes, you will throw your right foot against the weak side of your enemy and thus you will strike him with a false thrust from below upwards to the arms or to the hands, with a reverse blow turned from above in the manner of a mill, and your left leg will follow the right from behind, and there you will settle in a long and narrow stance, with your sword, but with your dagger you will take the guard of the head and there you will engage neatly with your arms and gallant legs.

[23] (P75.S2)
Of the sixth part, being you the agent.

[24] (P75.S3)
Then, being in the fifth part with the sword remaining in a long and narrow guard, but with the dagger in high guard, I want you to strike him with a half downward cut towards the hand of his dagger, and I do this so that your enemy will attack you; but be careful that when he strikes at your head, you will step back four or six inches with your right foot opposite his right side, and thus you will deliver a reverse strike to his right leg and parry his blow with your dagger, and for your defense, you will throw your right foot behind your left, delivering a thrust to his face beneath your dagger, so that you will be in a long and high guard with your sword, and your dagger will be in a narrow iron door guard, and your left foot will be forward, and there you will position yourself well and neatly.

That which concerns the seventh part: of walking.

[28] (P76.S3)
Now pay close attention that in the sixth part, if you recall well, you remained with the sword in the long tail and your dagger in the narrow iron guard. From here you will stand alert, watching your enemy as he strikes you with a downward cut to the head or to the leg; but first we shall say if he strikes you to the head with the said downward cut: as he draws such a cut, you will parry it with the true edge of your dagger, and in such a parry you will thrust your right foot strongly towards the enemy's left side, thus delivering a firm thrust to his flanks, or you may wish to give him a half downward cut to the legs; but be careful if you push the thrust, for your defense requires that you draw a reverse winding with your right leg from behind the left, and the said reverse you will execute in the manner of a spinning motion, which will go outside of your right leg, and your sword will not pass low and high, and your dagger will remain in the narrow iron guard.

That speaks of the eighth play: for offense and for defense.

[32] (P77.S3)
Now note that if you were to strike the mandritto to the leg, it is necessary that for your defense you draw a roverso while retreating your right foot, which roverso you will execute from your left side, that is, you will draw it from beneath your left armpit, and this is called a roverso sgualembrato; and take care that your sword does not pass long and high, and your dagger will remain at the narrow iron gate with your arms and legs well positioned.

[35] (P78.S2)
Of the ninth part which speaks of being patient against the thrust.

[36] (P78.S3)
If you remember well, you remained with the dagger at the narrow iron door, but with the sword in a long and high tail, as I mentioned above; but if your enemy were to strike the forehand at your weak leg, this forehand I want you to know can be parried in several ways, which you will see.

[37] (P78.S4)
First, you can parry it with the true edge of the dagger, turning it outward from the left leg with a strong twist of the fist; you can also parry it with the false edge without making any turn, and in these types of parries, you can step forward with your right foot and thrust with the point, or you can strike from above, or you can target the leg.

[38] (P78.S5)
And also to these such forehand strikes, you can deliver a forehand cross to the arm of his sword, retreating, by drawing back your right foot a little to the side, so that your sword will lower into a narrow iron door and your dagger will be in a high guard; and know that for all these parries and wounds for your defense, you must take two or three steps back and make a strong fist turn, and thus you will position yourself with the sword in a long and high guard, and your dagger will be at a narrow iron door, and there you will wait for your enemy to strike at your leg, for here I want to give you another parry, different from those above; now note.

[41] (P79.S2)
Which deals with the counter to one who strikes you with a downward blow to the leg.

[42] (P79.S3)
Now pay attention, for being in the said guard as I told you in the fourth part, you must be vigilant, because if he wishes to strike the aforementioned downward cut to your leg, I want you to counter it in these two ways: know that when he strikes the downward cut, you will place the false edge of your sword beneath his downward cut and thus you will sever with an upward cut to the right leg, and your dagger will go into a high guard, and for your protection, you will strike with an upward false edge, retreating with your right foot behind, and there you will settle as I previously mentioned in the eighth part.

I'm sorry, but it seems that you haven't provided the text you want translated. Please provide the specific text from Achille Marozzo's work, and I'll be happy to help with the translation.

[45] (P80.S2)
That denotes being patient against the forehand.

[46] (P80.S3)
To this very same thrust to the leg that the enemy will make, I want you to place the false edge of your sword against his, that is, the straight edge, and at the same time you will deliver a false strike to his head with your right foot stepping forward, so that your sword will descend in a narrow iron gate and your dagger will go into a guard position for the head; and for your defense, you will throw your right foot behind the left, thrusting a point unexpectedly to the face from below with your dagger, and there you will make a half turn of the fist, and thus you will position yourself in a high and long guard with your sword, and with your dagger, you will set yourself in a high iron gate, and there you will wait for your enemy to strike at you from above or at the leg, well polished and gallant.

[49] (P81.S2)
Of the manner in which one must hold against the reverse.

[50] (P81.S3)
Now guard that being with the sword in the long and high guard and with the dagger in the high iron door as I said above in the ninth part, from here it must be considered that if your enemy were to strike you with a reverse to the head or to the leg, at this reverse have the heart, for I want you to know that at the time he strikes his said reverse you will step with your left foot close to the right and there you will let his reverse pass; and once the said reverse has passed so that it cannot harm you, then you will strongly advance with your right foot and thus you will strike him with another reverse to the legs and your sword will not leave the long and narrow guard and your dagger will go into the high guard; and for your defense you will thrust at him, fleeing with your right foot behind your left, from beneath your dagger, which will go to the face of your enemy, in such a way that you will return to the guard as I taught you above, that is, with your left foot forward and your sword and dagger in the usual manner, and there you will set yourself neatly with your arms and legs as much as possible.

[53] (P82.S2)
Of the way to make the enemy yield.

[54] (P82.S3)
And know that being in a long and high guard with your left foot forward, as I mentioned above, from here you will stand poised and constrain your enemy in this manner: that is, you will strike him with a false strike from below upwards with your sword, in such a way that by force he will respond with a backward strike either to the head or to the leg.

[55] (P82.S4)
Know that you will parry these thrusts with the true edge of your dagger, especially by turning the tip of your finger towards the ground, that is, from the inside of your body. And when you have parried his thrust, you will throw your right foot forward, towards his weary side, and thus you will deliver another wild thrust to him to the head, which will descend towards his legs and arms, in such a way that your sword will fall in a long and extended manner, and your dagger will go into a guard position at the head; and for your defense, you will strike with a feint or you will want to make a thrust, retreating with your right foot behind the left, so that you will return with the sword and your dagger as I have said above, well positioned.

Of the last part of the sword and dagger, being patient against one who would strike you with a false thrust from the hand of your dagger.

[59] (P83.S3)
Being you in a long and high guard with your left foot forward and your dagger at the iron door, and your sword as I have said above, from there you must be cautious because if your enemy attempts to deceive you with a false strike using the dagger, I want you to make a clever fist turn, so that your dagger will go into a long and narrow guard, and there you will parry the false strike with the true edge of said dagger. In such a parry, you will advance with your right foot, thus you will thrust him with a firm point from below upwards into the chest, or you may wish to deliver a middle thrust to the leg that he has forward. And for your defense, you will step back two or three paces, and then you will settle into a long and high guard with your arms and legs well positioned and the dagger in a tight iron door.

[62] (P84.S2)
Above the document of three or four steps.

[63] (P84.S3)
Know that in these places where I make you take three or four steps back, I do so because by giving a thrust to your enemy, he would endure that you give him another in order to have the chance to strike you in that fury; but if you take those steps back as mentioned above, his anger will lessen and he will not come at you so beastly.

[64] (P84.S4)
Therefore, do not forget.

Which speaks of the manner that one should hold when fighting with a dagger, one person to another.

[68] (P85.S3)
Now know that I will compose for you a fight with the dagger alone, which will be a very useful and brief thing, especially for one who has to choose the weapons and give the method, if one were stronger than the other, to come to grips.

Of the second part of the dagger alone.

[73] (P86.S3)
Being in a long and narrow guard and your enemy thrusts at you with the point of the dagger, as you withdraw from said point, you will raise your hand to the side so that you pass his point, and at the same time you will deliver a reverse cut across the top of his arm with the dagger; and if he thrusts at you from the right towards your head, you will parry with the straight edge of the dagger and then deliver a downward strike to his head; and you will make a half turn of the fist and thus you will also return to the long and narrow guard, well arranged, maintaining the order as before.

Of the third part: of the patient.

[77] (P87.S3)
Being in a long and narrow guard with the dagger, I want you to hold it in the usual manner, that is, with the left foot forward and the right foot back, while never taking your eyes off the enemy's right hand, for if he attempts to strike you with a forehand or backhand to the leg, I want you to pull your leg slightly towards you, so that he cannot harm you. Then quickly you will thrust your right foot forward and strike him with a backhand to the face; and once you have delivered the said backhand, you will step back four or five paces and set yourself in a long and narrow guard, as well-polished as possible, and always keep your gaze on the aforementioned hand.

Of the fourth part: you shall be patient against the forehand.

[81] (P88.S3)
Being left in a long and narrow tail and your enemy strikes you with a downward blow to the head, to this downward blow you will throw your left foot towards the right side of your enemy, so that in such a passing you will place the true edge of your dagger against the downward blow he is delivering, and at the very same time that you make such a parry, you will thrust your left hand inside his aforementioned arm and thus give him a twist outward, so that you will strike him with a point in the chest; but I strongly doubt that due to the impact you will give him, he will not be compelled to abandon the dagger or that he will turn his back on you.

[82] (P88.S4)
But take care that when you make such a grip, it is necessary that you place your left hand underneath your dagger.

[83] (P88.S5)
But once you have your enemy, you will take four or five steps back and set yourself in a long and narrow stance, well polished and graceful.

Of the fifth and last part: of the patient against the point.

[87] (P89.S3)
Now note that if you find yourself in a long and narrow position and your enemy thrusts at you from below with his dagger, I want you to simultaneously deliver a reverse strike over his right arm, with a reverse thrust to his chest at the same time, without moving either your feet or your legs; and once you have made these two strikes, you shall step back four or five paces and then you will set yourself as I have shown you above.

[92] (P90.S4)
But take heed that it is necessary for you to always keep your eye on the hand of your companion's dagger, for as the weapons are shorter, I want you to know that they are more dangerous.

Of the second part of the agent.

[96] (P91.S3)
Being in a long and narrow line and if your enemy were like you, I want you to take a great step with your left foot to the outside of his right leg, and in doing so, you will thrust your cloak into the arm of the enemy's dagger, in such a way that he will not be able to move his right arm; and then you will strike him with a thrust or, if you wish, with a reverse cut to the neck, and for your defense, you will pull back two or three steps and thus you will set yourself in this same guard, as I have told you above.

[100] (P92.S3)
Now, having remained in the second part in a long and narrow tail, I want you to lower your cloak, so that your enemy has cause to strike from above, whether it be a descending blow, a thrust, or a straight round, as long as he strikes from above.

[101] (P92.S4)
Now watch that it is necessary to be attentive, for when he will strike with his fingers, as I told you, in that strike he makes you will give him a good thrust inside the arm with his dagger, without moving either foot or legs, except that your left foot will go behind the right; and from there you will throw your right foot behind the left making a good turn of the fist and you will have gone into a long and high stance, that is, you will be with your left foot forward, and there you will stand with your arms and legs well positioned.

[105] (P93.S3)
Being remained in the third part in long and high guard, I want you to present the less uncovered side to your enemy, that is, by pushing your cloak inward, towards your right side: and I do this so that your enemy has reason to strike at that uncovered area; so that you have the heart that if he were to thrust a point of his right foot at your face or upward from below at your sides, you will strongly deflect that point outward with your cloak, in such a way that you will give him a reverse strike across the face at the same time; and know that when you deflect the said point, in delivering the said reverse you will step strongly forward with your right foot and your left leg will follow behind the right, and having done this you will pull back three or four steps and thus you will settle in a long and narrow guard, well polished.

[109] (P94.S3)
Being in a long and narrow guard and your enemy is in that same guard, or in another, however you wish, I want you to maintain this order, always keeping his fist or arm attached to the dagger, with straight and reverse thrusts, that never pass beyond the long and narrow guard or high iron gate, always pressing him, so that one foot catches the other and always the right foot forward: and if you do this, he will never be able to strike you in a way that can harm you; therefore do not forget to follow this path because, while he attempts to strike you, I have given you all the remedies for what he can do to you, and thus you will be careful that he does not deceive you in any way, for as long as you maintain this order, he cannot deceive you.

Being in a long and high guard and your enemy is wherever he pleases, outside the iron door, I want you to thrust at him with a reverse point to the face and a reverse blow, stepping forward with your right foot, so that your sword will lower into a long and narrow guard; then, if your enemy responds with any strike, you will step back with your right foot behind the left across and thus deliver a horizontal strike to the arm of his sword, so that your sword will lower into the iron door guard; and from there you will make a half turn of the fist and you will also settle back into a long and high guard, well polished with your cape spread out in front.

[121] (P97.S3)
Being you remained in a long and high guard and your enemy thrusts a stab at your face, I want you to deflect that thrust outward with your cloak, and at the same time that you deflect it, you will step strongly forward and thus you will push him away with your right foot with a firm point to the sides, and your left foot will follow straight behind; and for your defense, you will take two or three steps back and thus you will position yourself in a narrow iron door, and from here you will make a fine thrust with your cloak, so take note.

[125] (P98.S3)
You know that in the second part you remain at the narrow iron door: from here you will thrust with a point towards the face of your enemy, stepping forward with your right foot four fingers; and it is understood that you thrust it from the inside, so that he, fearing the said point, will parry it with his right edge inward, towards his weak side, and will come to expose his strong side; and then you will step forward with your left foot strongly towards his said strong side, and in such a step you will throw your cloak in his face, not leaving that part which you have wrapped around your left arm: know that you will not pull it more than half of the said cloak, and in such a pull you will drive him with a point in the chest; and for your defense you will throw your left leg strongly back from the right, and in such a throw you will give a pull to the said cloak, so that you will step three or four paces back, and in that same moment you will wrap your cloak around your arm and thus you will set yourself in a long and high guard as polished as possible.

[129] (P99.S3)
Being in a long and high guard and your enemy strikes at you with a downward cut to the head or a crooked thrust, have the heart that when he delivers such a blow, you will thrust your right foot strongly forward and place your cloak on the arm of his sword, and in that same action of placing the cloak and stepping, you will thrust a cut to his right arm and a reverse cut to the throat, all at once; but when you cut the reverse to the throat, you will step back with your right foot behind your left and thrust a reverse point to the face of the enemy, so that you will have returned to a long and high guard with your left foot forward; and there you will set yourself well, polished, with your arms and legs well positioned.

You know that in the fourth part you remained in a long and high guard with your left foot forward: from here you will make a feint with the said left leg, so that he has reason to strike a reverse at the said leg; but know that when he strikes the said reverse, you will make a foot disguise, that is, you will draw your left foot back behind the right, so that his reverse will pass by; but when his reverse has passed and cannot harm you, you will advance with your right foot and thrust him with a reverse point to the face, between his sword and his cloak, with a reverse cut to the legs along with the said point, so that your sword will lower into a long and narrow guard; and from there for your defense you will throw your right leg back behind the left and thrust him with a point to the face; and having thrust with the said point, you will throw your left leg back behind the right, so that you will find yourself in a long and narrow guard with your arms well extended towards the right of your enemy; and from here you will make a great inward fist turn, so that you will have gone into a narrow iron gate.

Thus, having remained at the narrow iron gate, from here you will strike below and above with some false strikes with the hand of your enemy's sword: and I do this so that you may give him the feint, so that he has reason to pay attention to those false strikes; and you, seeing the moment, will pass strongly with your left leg outward, towards his right side, and thus you will throw your cloak in his face, in such a way that you can give him what you wish; and know that in order to make this thrust, it is necessary that you place the cloak on your arm loosely and not too tightly wrapped, so that you can abandon it when you please, and this throw of the cloak is differentiated from the first because in the first you do not abandon the cloak, but in this one, you do.

Now pay attention that in this last part you will set yourself in a long and high guard, well polished, because if your enemy strikes at your leg or head, I want you to do it this way: that is, if he strikes at your left side, you will throw your left leg towards the right side, and in this throw, you will place the straight edge of your sword against the blow of your enemy, which he will deliver, and at the same time with that guard, you will strongly thrust your right foot forward and thus deliver a downward strike in the manner of a tramazzon to his head, so that your sword will descend into a wide iron gate; at that moment, being you positioned in the said wide iron gate and your enemy strikes at you from above and below with some blow, you will counter his strike with a false strike from below upwards and thus deliver a reverse cut to his right thigh, passing with your left foot in such a way as to cut towards his right side; and for your defense, you will throw your left foot behind your right and thus thrust with a point to the face, and in thrusting from there, you will take three or four steps back and thus you will set yourself in a long and high guard, well polished and gallant as much as possible.

Being you remained with the left sword in the high iron door and that of the right hand in a long and high tail as I first told you, from here you will strike your enemy with a false edge from below upwards towards the hands of the enemy with your straight sword, and once you have executed the said false, you will give him a little uncovered to the upper sides, so that he has reason to strike there; but know that if he were to thrust, whether straight, or reverse, or point, to all these strikes, when he strikes at you, you will throw your right leg strongly forward and in such a throw you will place the straight sword, hitting upwards, under your left, so that they will be crossed, and you will give him with your straight sword a reverse to that leg which he has forward, so that the straight sword will be lowered in a long and narrow tail and that of the left hand will have gone into a long and high tail; then if your enemy were to strike at your head, you will throw the left foot forward, towards his right side, and thus you will parry the enemy's strike on the straight edge of the sword that you will have in your left hand and with the right you will give him a disordered straight, starting from the head and descending to the tips of the feet, not stopping anything of the said left foot, for soon you will return it behind the right, striking with the left hand a disordered straight that will descend into the iron door guard and the right will go into a long and narrow tail and there you will remain well polished and gallant.

Of the fifth part, how you shall be acting.

[175] (P110.S3)
You know that you are left with the left sword in the narrow iron guard and the right one in the long and narrow tail with the right foot forward: from here you will strike with the sword you have in your left hand with a false move from below upwards towards the right hand of the enemy, stepping forward with your left leg, and with the right sword you will deliver a downward strike to the legs, so that your right sword will be in the narrow iron guard and the left will be in the long and narrow tail with the left foot forward; and know that when you make this strike, you must find your enemy in a high iron guard and in a long and narrow tail or with the two swords crossed: in this way you can strike securely.

[176] (P110.S4)
Thus, being placed in these two guards, if your enemy strikes at your head or leg, you will throw your right leg forward and cross your swords, and in that way you will have parried and will deliver to him a reverse strike of your right sword to his legs.

[177] (P110.S5)
But we propose that being you in a long and narrow tail and in the iron gate, with your left foot forward, your enemy should not strike you with any blow: I want you, with your left sword, to thrust a point between his two swords, stepping forward with your right foot: it is understood that he is with his sword in the left hand in the iron gate or in the long and narrow tail, and I do this because by pushing the said point, he will expose his left side; then you, seeing such exposure, will give him with your right hand sword a straight thrust to his left arm or you may choose to aim for his left leg; and if he should strike you, for your defense you will cross the swords together, not moving any foot and thus you will give him with your right sword a reverse strike to the legs; and once you have made the said reverse strike, you will throw your right leg back behind the left and will cross your swords together again, so that you will be with the sword in your left hand in a high iron gate and that in your right will be in a long and high tail, and there you will position yourself well with your arms and legs.

I want you to know that when you are with the sword in hand and with the wide brocchiero, you will set yourself in a long and high guard, that is, with your left foot forward, tight with your sword and the brocchiero together: and I do this so that you may be patient, that is, that you wait for the enemy to strike first before you do, making you understand that when a man fights with knives, naturally he cannot make more than three strikes, namely a downward cut, an upward cut, and a thrust; but there are some who say that one can make more than these three aforementioned strikes: I confirm to you that it can be done, that is, many kinds of strikes can be made, but still, whether one wishes to strike with knives, I tell you that in the beginning he can do nothing other than these three aforementioned strikes.

[195] (P114.S5)
Thus, we shall establish at this beginning that he makes the thrust first: I want that as he makes the said thrust, you will step your right foot towards his weary side, and in this stepping, you will strike with the false edge of your sword from below upwards into his thrust, and thus you will deliver a reverse cut to his legs, and your hilt will be above your sword; and for your defense, you will throw your right foot behind the left, and in this throwing, you will unsheathe a crooked downward strike towards the arm of the said enemy's sword, which sword will lower in a tight iron guard; in fact, you will throw your left foot behind the right, and in this throwing, you will make a half turn of the fist and thus you will position yourself in a long and narrow stance, that is, with the right foot forward, and the sword will be outside of your right leg, well polished and well extended with your arms and legs; and from here I want you to be the agent, that is, I want you to be the first to strike.

Therefore, note, forever, that when you are in a long and high guard and your enemy strikes you with a reverse, you must be aware that as he strikes, you will quickly draw your left foot back next to the right and allow his reverse to pass. Once his reverse has passed, you will push off with your right foot and strike him with a reverse to the legs, or you may choose to thrust upward into his chest; and indeed, while drawing back the said reverse, you will strike him with a false thrust to his hands, with a firm reverse thrust. And for your defense, you will step back with your right foot behind the left and then strike him with a cross straight thrust, and your sword will drop into a hanging guard; and from there, you will not move at all, for this guard is a good guard for being patient, that is, when one wishes to wait for the opponent to strike before him. Therefore, be sure that when you thrust the said point toward the chest, it is necessary for your right foot to step back a large step behind the left, and at the moment you retreat the said foot, you will thrust upward from below to the face of the enemy, accompanied by the hilt; and indeed, you will settle into a long and extended guard and there you will wait for the said enemy to strike before you.

[224] (P121.S3)
You know that you remain in a long and high guard: it is necessary for you to consider in which guard your enemy will be.

[225] (P121.S4)
Now, let us suppose that you find him at a narrow or high iron gate: from there I want you to be the agent, that is, you will be the first to strike; finding him in the aforementioned guards, you will push him with the point of your right foot stepping forward, which point will go outside of your enemy's sword, that is, false for false, thrusting that point strongly to the face from his weaker side; and he, out of fear of that point, will extend the arm of his sword, and at that moment you will strike him with a downward cut between his sword and his buckler, which will strike hard against his head, and your sword will not pass the guard of the face, because by nature he will respond to you with his head; and responding to you with his head, I want you to then direct the point of your sword towards his face, accompanied under your buckler, and you will give him a guard to enter; and at the same time you will step with your left foot towards his right side and thus you will give him a reverse strike to his right temple, which reverse will not pass the guard of the long and high tail; and for your defense, you will take a large step back with your left foot from the right and you will strike him with a straight thrust, which will descend to the wide iron gate; and from there you will make a half turn of the fist and thus you will settle in a long and narrow tail with your right foot forward, with your arms and legs well extended and polished and with the sword held tight together with your buckler.

[229] (P122.S3)
Being you remained in a long and narrow tail, from there I want you to pass with your left foot towards the enemy's left side and, in this passing, you will thrust with a false thrust to the enemy's left temple, in such a way that he will expose his lower parts out of fear of the said false thrust; and then you will strike him with a forehand to the legs, that is, by passing, in making such a forehand, with your right foot forward, and your sword will lower to a wide iron gate; and if your enemy, in such a lowering, were to strike you or not strike you, I want you to throw your left foot towards the enemy's right side and, at that time, you will thrust with a false point, that is, turning the wrist of your right hand upwards, cutting with a backhand to the leg of the aforementioned; and when you cut such a backhand, I want you, for your defense, to thrust the hilt of the sword, that is, the point, strongly forward to the face of your enemy, accompanied below your buckler and, in thrusting with such a point, you will throw your left foot a great step back from the right; and in this throwing you will turn a backhand in the act of a windmill, that is, a backhand cutting across his right arm, not moving your right leg forward from the left: in this way you will remain in a long and narrow tail, with your arms and legs well polished and tight.

Which deals with the lowering of the sword alone.

[233] (P123.S3)
This is a breakdown of the sword alone, which is an excellent thing for teaching anyone who might have to engage in dagger strikes with a blade in hand; therefore, I encourage you, should it happen that you teach someone who is to fight with this sword alone, you will refer to these things composed in this book.

[234] (P123.S4)
Now pay attention, for I want you to set yourself in a long and narrow stance, with your right foot forward and the left foot positioned behind the right, and the left hand behind your back, while the sword arm is strongly extended forward toward your enemy; and from there you will strike with a false edge round to the face of your enemy, with a descending strike at the same time, which will fall like a wide iron gate, increasing as you push your right foot forward; and if at that moment your enemy were to strike at your head or leg, at the time he strikes, you will hit with a false edge from below upwards against the hand of your enemy's sword, and thus you will sever with a crosswise descending strike to the face, meaning you will execute two actions at the same time: the left leg will push the right one forward and your sword will fall like a wide iron gate.

[235] (P123.S5)
Being at the said iron gate wide, and if your enemy should thrust at you with a stab or a downward strike to the head or an upward cut, for each of these blows I want you to strike with the false edge of your sword against his blow that he will deliver, and in such striking, you will take a large step with your left foot forward, towards the right side of the enemy, and in this stepping, you will deliver a disordered upward cut that will take from the head down to the tips of his feet; and for your defense, you will throw your left foot a large step back from the right, and in such throwing, you will deliver a downward cross strike to the arm of his sword, which will fall to the narrow iron gate; and from there you will make a half turn of the fist and thus you will position yourself in a long and narrow guard, as I told you above, also with your sword arm well extended towards the right of the enemy's finger and the left leg arranged as mentioned above.

[239] (P124.S3)
Now, being in a long and narrow guard and your enemy still in this same guard, or if he is in a long and high guard, from there I want you to advance with your left foot forward, and in this advance, you will give him a false thrust, that is, a round thrust with your enemy's sword from the inside, in such a way that you will strike him with a round reverse to the face, advancing at the same time with your right foot forward; but know that for your defense you will throw your right foot back behind the left: in such a throw you will deliver another reverse strike with your lifted leg, which will drop into a long and high guard, and there you will be patient, that is, you will wait for the said enemy to strike at you, so take note.

[240] (P125.S0)

[242] (P125.S2)
That speaks of four counteractions against the thrust.

[243] (P125.S3)
I now wish to show you that, should you find yourself in a long and high guard, if your enemy strikes at you with a thrust to the face, I will give you four very perfect and secure counters to this thrust: first, against the aforementioned thrust, as he strikes at your face, you will step forward with your right foot, strongly towards the weak side of your enemy, and in this advance, you will place the true edge against his thrust and thus deliver a reverse point to his face, or you may choose to cut a reverse to the said face; or you may wish to meet this thrust with a false strike from below upwards, still stepping forward with your right foot, then passing with your right foot towards the weak side of your enemy, and in this passing, you can then deliver a reverse cut across, which will catch his sword arm.

[244] (P125.S4)
Now note here that by making these four guards and striking by yourself, one stops, for when you stop the aforementioned thrust and you have pushed the reverse point, at that moment you will not move your sword from the guard of the face, because, drawing him with a straight thrust, round or descending or thrust or point, I want you to parry these blows in line with the sword, in the act of entering guard; at the time of such a parry, you will step with your left foot towards the right side of the enemy and thus you will strike him with a reverse blow to the right temple, and the right leg will follow the left from behind, and your sword will not pass from the guard of the long and high tail; and in this way you will have returned to perfect guard to parry the thrust.

[245] (P125.S5)
Again, when you have parried the aforementioned thrust and you are cutting the reverse to the face, I want you, for your defense, to throw your right foot back from the left, and in such a throw, you will deliver another reverse crossed with the lifted leg, and your sword will have returned to the aforementioned guard of long and high tail, as I told you above, that is, you will be left with your left foot forward; and also, by parrying the said thrust with the false of your sword from below upwards, to strike him with a reverse cut to the legs, at that moment for your defense you will throw your right foot back to the left and, in such a throw, you will deliver a false crossed from below upwards to his sword arm, with a downward cut slicing him to the face, and your sword will have returned to the aforementioned guard, as I told you above.

[248] (P126.S2)
What is said against the aforementioned thrust.

[249] (P126.S3)
Being that you have remained as I previously notified you, still in the guard of long and high tail, and your enemy thrusts at you, you know that I told you above that you can then step with your right foot forward towards the weak side of your enemy and strike in such a passing with a reverse cross; and indeed, for your defense, you will throw your right foot behind your left and thus you will deliver a straight thrust to the arm of his sword, which straight thrust will descend in the iron gate; and from there you will make a half turn with your fist and you will be returned as I taught you above, that is, in long and high tail.

[253] (P127.S3)
Now note that while you are still in a long and high guard and someone thrusts at you, I want you, at the moment he makes the aforementioned thrust, to step strongly with your right foot towards the left side of your enemy, and in this passing, you will thrust a point into his flank; and indeed you will make a half turn of the fist and thus you will set yourself in a long and narrow guard with your right foot well forward and positioned, and your sword arm well extended towards the enemy’s right, while your left foot is positioned behind the right.

Being you in a long and narrow guard and your enemy in a long and high guard, or narrow like yours, here I want you to throw your left foot towards his right side, and in such a throw, you will strike him with a forehand across his sword hand, strongly, so that your sword will lower into a narrow iron guard; and there immediately you will step forward with your right foot and give him a backhand to the legs; and for your defense, you will throw your right foot behind your left, and in such a throw, you will deliver another awkward backhand with your lifted leg, and your sword will be lowered into a long and high guard; and from there you will throw your right foot forward and thus you will settle into a narrow iron guard with your left leg positioned behind the right.

[261] (P129.S3)
Being you gone into the narrow iron gate and your enemy being as you are, at that moment I want you to step forward with your right foot and strike with a false from below upwards against your enemy's sword, in such a way that yours will meet his in a false for false manner: at that moment I want you to push strongly with your left foot forward, towards his right side, and you will place your leg outside of his right, so that he does not strike you with a leg kick; and in this advancing that you will make with your left foot, you will make a half turn of the fist and thus you will thrust a straight point towards his face, raising your hand upwards, in such a way that, out of fear of the pointed finger, he will raise the arm of his sword outward; and then you will throw your left hand at his sword or to the right arm of that sword and you will make a grip; and if you do not wish to make a grip, at the moment he raises, you will step with your right foot towards his left side and in such passing you will give him a straight cross to his arm with the sword, or to the head, repeated, that is, you will strike him twice at one time, with straight strikes, and the last will fall to the wide iron gate; and if your enemy were to strike you at all, you will strike with a false from below upwards against his sword and thus you will give him a reverse to the head, passing with your left foot towards his right side; and for your defense, you will throw your right foot behind the left and, in this throwing, you will strike him with a thrust above the hand to the face and your sword will fall into the iron gate; and then you will make a half turn of the fist and thus you will set yourself in a long and narrow guard with your right foot forward, well polished.

[342] (P149.S3)
Remaining in a long and high guard to await the enemy who strikes a thrust to the face or a downward cut to the left leg, which will be forward, or a descending strike to the head, I want you to be attentive, that is, to watch his sword hand, for if he wishes to thrust, it is necessary that he first pulls his fist back, and if he were to strike downward to the head or a straight cut to the leg, it is necessary that he raises the fist of that hand a little to the side: thus, always note that by watching the fist you will see what the enemy intends to do, etc.

[343] (P149.S4)
Let us first suppose that he thrusts at your face: I want you to deflect this thrust from the outside with your shield, and with your right foot, you will deliver a downward strike to his legs, or you may choose a thrust to the left side, and the left leg will follow the right from behind; and for your defense, you will throw your right foot behind the left with a strong punch, and thus you will also position yourself in a long and high guard.

[344] (P149.S5)
Having returned to the long and high guard, if your enemy strikes down at your head, I want you, as he raises his sword hand, to thrust forward with your right foot strongly under the enemy. In this thrust, you will place your shield against his sword hand, and then you will either stab him in the side or choose to cut him with a downward strike to his arm, likewise, with an upward cut to his chest, that is, stepping forward with your right foot; after these two strikes, you will then step back with your left foot a good distance from the right: in this step, you will deliver a strong cross strike to the arm of his sword, and your sword will descend to a narrow iron gate; and once you have executed each of these strikes, I want you to thrust that foot which has been advanced to strike, I want you to thrust it back from the other, that is, with the point that you know is made under the shield for your defense; and from there, you will make a strong turn of the fist and return to the aforementioned guard of long and high, with the left foot forward.

While in this same guard, that is, with a long and high tail, if your enemy were at a high iron gate or a narrow iron gate, you can still make these two strikes, that is, thrusting forward with your right foot, the said point towards the face as I have mentioned before, and at the moment you touch his sword, you will step forward with your left foot a great step towards the enemy's right side, and in that step, you will place your shield on his sword arm from underneath, so that he cannot move it, and then you will give him a straight strike to his right thigh; and in delivering the straight strike, your right foot will follow the left from behind; and if you do not wish to do this, you can thrust with the said point, the right foot forward, and he, as he raises his sword, at that moment you will turn a reverse strike towards that right leg; and once you have delivered the said reverse, or the straight strike I mentioned above, I want you, for your protection, to step back with your right foot a great step behind the left, and in that step, you will thrust a point from underneath towards the enemy's face, accompanied by the hand of the sword under the shield.

[353] (P151.S4)
But let us suppose that you had executed the forehand strike with your left leg, aimed at the enemy's thigh: it is necessary to throw back the aforementioned left arm behind the right, driving in such a throw a point towards the face of the aforementioned as I have said before; and indeed you will make a great fist turn and thus you will position yourself in a long and narrow stance with your arms and legs well polished.

Being in a long and narrow guard and your enemy is at the high iron gate, or narrow, or in a long and high guard, I want you to step forward with your left foot and make a false thrust from below towards the hand of your enemy's sword, which false thrust will go under the arm of the shield and the said shield well extended; and at the same time you will step forward with your right foot, towards his left side, and thus you will strike him with a reverse blow to the legs, and your sword will drop into a long and narrow guard; but if your enemy responds with a strike to the head or leg, I want you to step back with your right foot a great step behind the left and, in this stepping back, you will give him a horizontal strike to the arm of the sword, and your sword will go to the high iron gate; and if at that moment your enemy strikes at your head, I want you to step forward with your right foot a great step and, in this stepping forward, you will accompany the sword and your shield together in a guard against the head and there you will parry his blow that he will make, and indeed, you will strike him with a direct and reverse blow under your firm shield; and then, for your defense, you will step back with your right foot a great step behind the left and thus you will thrust a point from below upwards towards his face, accompanied by the hand of the sword under the shield, and from there you will make a great winding motion with your fist and thus you will set yourself in a long and high guard well polished, with your sword and shield well extended and polished.

Now guard: if you remember well, you remained in the long and high tail; therefore, it is necessary that you be patient, for when your enemy strikes you with a forehand or backhand or thrust, you will pass your right leg across, opposite to his right side, and thus you will strike in such a way with a backhand cut traversing from his right side, so that your sword will descend in the long and narrow tail; and from there I want you to strike with a round forehand to the feet that will turn, with a backhand thrust passing, strongly driving it to the face of the enemy from his side, with your left leg forward opposite to his left side; and thus you will turn for your defense a backhand to the legs of the said enemy, retreating your left leg behind from the right, so that your sword will return to that same guard as before, that is when you begin the forehand, which guard is the long and narrow tail with the right foot forward; and ensure that all the strikes you make, you keep the hand of the sword covered under the shield, and in this way you will proceed safely, striking also together with the said backhand a false forehand from below upwards towards the hands of the enemy.

[398] (P162.S4)
Then, if your enemy is acting or suffering, you will deliver a reverse strike, unbalanced, between the sword and the shield of said enemy, with a reverse thrust together, firm with the said right leg; and after you have executed the reverse thrust, for your defense you will throw your right leg behind the left, drawing from a false straight from below upwards that will go in a long and high tail, and there you will position yourself well, waiting for your enemy to be acting while you are suffering.

Now, knowing that in this last part you remained in a long and high guard, I want you to deliver a straight thrust to your enemy's legs with the intention that, as he parries your thrust with his false edge under his guard to give you a reverse strike to your right leg, I want you that when you touch the false edge of your enemy's sword with your true edge, you will immediately make a winding motion with your fist to the inside, so that your sword's false edge will be against his false edge; and from there you will give him a cutting reverse strike to the leg that he will have forward and will not be able to miss, because with that winding motion you have made, you will have put him out of position, assuring yourself that for all your straight and reverse strikes that you will deliver both high and low, I tell you that you should always strike with the false edge, for your greater advantage, making you aware that sometimes when you deliver a round straight strike to the legs, you should also deliver a round reverse strike to the face, evading and drawing for your defense a reverse strike with your leg raised; and your right leg will go behind the left and the left behind the right with a false strike, so that you will remain in a long and narrow guard, returning from here backward from the play; that is, you will make a false and straight strike under guard with your right leg behind the left and your sword will be in a long and narrow guard well polished, placing the point of your sword in the guard inside or outside, and at that time winding strongly on your left leg towards your left side, so that your right leg will be behind the left in a position of reverence, immediately passing and placing your right leg a span forward; and there you will set yourself gallantly with your guard resting on your left side, holding your sword in high guard.

You shall have the said scholar set with the right leg forward, with the sword and the buckler, or targe, well extended towards the enemy's right and his sword accompanied together; and make sure that his right hand is outside of his right knee, with the wrist of the sword hand turned down towards the ground, as you see here in the present figure; and this is called Long and Narrow Tail and stands thus to strike as well as to parry; and therefore, being the said scholar in the said guard, you will show him how many strikes can be made if he wishes to be the agent, and afterwards, being patient, you will show him how many parries can be made, from high and low, varied from one another, and you will give him the parries with his strikes of that nature that will occur to him; and you will have him thrust with a crooked forehand, passing across with his left leg somewhat forward from the right: then you will tell him that his sword has dropped into the Narrow Iron Gate.

You shall make your scholar understand that whenever he is in the aforementioned guard, he is obliged to be patient, for the reason that all low guards are primarily for parrying rather than for striking; but even if he wishes to strike before parrying, you know that he can only strike with the point, or with some false strikes, and therefore you shall show the said scholar that being in the aforementioned guard, if someone were to strike him with any blow, in what manner he should parry and then strike, encouraging him that he should parry more with false strikes than with any other edge, for it is more useful to be parried than not with the true edge, knowing that the false can strike and parry at the same time; and having made this examination, you shall have him pass with his right leg forward, raising the hand of his sword to the air, and this is called High Guard.

Being your student in the said High Guard, you will show him how many strikes can be drawn from it, making him understand that this guard is primarily for striking; and afterwards you will show him the parries with their strikes, stepping each time with his legs forward or backward, according to what may happen; and then you will make him step forward with his left leg, lowering the sword to the middle of the body, and this will be called Long and High Tail.

[428] (P169.S3)
I want you to know that being patient, this is a good and useful guard, and for this reason I tell you that you should instruct your students that they must position themselves for their defense against their enemy in this guard, making them understand what can be done to them, for and against, in every manner that is possible: because by doing this you honor yourself and benefit them, and you are obliged to do so, making them fulfill their duty against you; and therefore you will make them advance and retreat as circumstances may allow, always returning to the same guard, with some strikes or with some parries; and once you have given them such teachings, you will make them execute a downward strike, passing from their right leg forward, which will land in a narrow or wide Iron Gate.

[432] (P170.S3)
Now it seems to me that one who is at the said narrow or wide iron gate, cannot make too many strikes, but I tell you that he can make many parries, that is, with false strikes using downward or upward cuts, of that nature which will seem to you, or you may parry in face guard or head guard or in some other ways, as it has been taught.

[433] (P170.S4)
But know that those things which can be done in a narrow or wide iron gate can also be done in a broad iron door for the most part; and for this reason, you should be careful to let the said scholar pass with his left leg forward and his sword will go in Long Tail and extended, that is, extending his sword and arm backward, alongside the right leg; and from there he can be both active and passive, as you will hear.

[437] (P171.S3)
Being your scholar in the said guard, you shall make him act, especially with false thrusts or you will want with bridges or reverses and other strikes that may arise from the said guard, with his preparations that follow closely, knowing that it is a small thing to wound, but to know how to parry is a more beautiful and more useful thing.

[438] (P171.S4)
Thus you will give them good practice in the aforementioned guards and strikes, always transitioning from guard to guard and from step to step, continually asking them the names of the aforementioned guards; and once you have received all these teachings, you will have them extend their leg straight forward to the left, and their sword will go with the point raised in the air with their arm extended, straight towards the enemy, as you will see here; and this will be called the Head Guard.

[439] (P172.S0)
Head guard.

[440] (P172.S1)
In this guard, one can be both agent and patient, but first we shall speak of the patient: patient is understood if one strikes you with a descending forehand, or an unbalanced forehand, or a straight thrust, to which blow you are forced to parry with the right scholar in the head guard; and then, wishing to be the agent from this guard, you will say that he can be the agent with a straight thrust above the hand or you will want a descending forehand or round or unbalanced or false straight, accompanying the aforementioned blows with a reverse in the manner that suits him; and from this head guard, you will make him go with a reverse thrust to the face of the enemy, throwing his left leg forward of the right somewhat across and the point of his sword will be to the right of the face of his enemy, and he will have gone into the entering guard.

[441] (P173.S0)
Guard of entering.

[442] (P173.S1)
Being in the aforementioned guard, it is necessary for you to be patient by force, because if I remember correctly, I have shown you that from such a guard, few strikes can arise, wanting him to be the first to act rather than be acted upon. Therefore, I urge you to wait for the enemy to strike, and when you are prepared, you will be able to make those strikes that seem suitable to you for the prepared blow, and according to the position in which your enemy finds himself. And note that from the aforementioned guard, you will make the said scholar move, with a reverse cut and with his right leg thrown forward to the left, pulling in this throw his right arm somewhat back, extending his fist towards the ground; and then you will tell him that his sword is lowered in a long and wide tail.

[443] (P174.S0)
Guard of the Long and Wide Tail.

[444] (P174.S1)
Note that in this guard one can be both agent and patient, for from here one can strike false and reverse, and thrust straight and false, and thrust reverse and false with a round point, with the reverse unbalanced returning the sword to its place; and one can also deliver thrusts, false thrusts straight and reverse, feints and non-feints, with the reverses that belong to them according to the nature of the thrusts they will deliver; and having made such an introduction, or training, you will have the aforementioned scholar place his left leg in front of the right and with the point of the sword turned towards the ground and the pommel towards the sky, and you will set him with the right arm extended and with the thumb of the hand turned downwards, towards the point of the sword, and having done this you will tell him that he has gone into the Guard of Becha.

[445] (P175.S0)
The Guard of Becha may.

[446] (P175.S1)
Having examined the aforementioned scholar from guard to guard, and considering that in said Guard of Becha he may, you will encourage your student to go into this guard when his enemy approaches the Wide or Narrow or High Iron Gate, following him step by step, the aforementioned, and from guard to guard: that is, if he goes into Long and Extended Tail, you will make him go into Becha Cesa, and if he goes into Long and Wide Tail, you will make him go into Long and Narrow Tail, and if he goes into Becha Cesa, you will make him go into High Iron Gate, and if he goes into Entering Guard, you will make him go into High Guard; maintaining this order, you will finally make him go with the right leg forward and with the point of the sword directed towards the face of the enemy and the wrist of the hand turned inward and the arm well extended, and you will tell him that he has gone into Face Guard.

[447] (P176.S0)
Face Guard.

[448] (P176.S1)
Having placed the aforementioned in the Guard of the Face, you will tell him that in this guard he is both patient and active at the same time, that is, when his enemy strikes a round or straight downward blow, at the moment of such a strike, the sword will be beneath the strike mentioned above, simultaneously striking with the point at the enemy's face, cutting for his own protection with a reverse; and while fleeing, he will deliver a disordered straight strike, with his right leg behind the left, which will descend in a polished iron Cinghiara, immediately returning with a doubled reverse to the front, stepping with the right foot and following with the left from behind, to his place and the arm of the sword extended high, turning the wrist of the hand outward, keeping the point of his sword aimed at the face or the fist of the aforementioned, well extended; and this is Becha cesa.

[449] (P177.S0)
The Guard of Becha ceases.

[450] (P177.S1)
You know that from the Face Guard you have made your scholar perform a reverse double in Becha cesa: from this, it is necessary to make him understand the pros and cons of said guard; and know that this guard, for one who is large, is very singular for striking and for parrying, informing you that from this guard can arise thrusts, false cuts, as I have shown you before and other things that at present I will not mention to avoid being too tedious in writing and to not give you too much weariness; but you will supply in those things that I will lack because I must continue with other matters.

INTRODUCTION.

[454] (P178.S3)
Having considered how important it is to know the names of these guards, which I have clearly composed in this book in writing and in painting, I have done so out of the love I bear for the armored knights who delight in fully understanding the art of arms, and because it seems to me that many who teach others strongly err by not making them understand the manner of walking and examining in all the guards one by one, by name, step by step; I have resolved to endure this little effort, for this arises from nothing other than the fact that there are currently few Masters who teach such virtue, or art, because they are endowed with little knowledge, as they teach more by practice than by anything else; and I am certain of this, for I know that many set out to teach, believing themselves to know, and do not know; and this happens because there are no longer, as there used to be in ancient times, the authenticated Masters, who if they were not first privileged by other Masters with their licenses, could not make scholars, for now everyone becomes a Master and makes scholars, and no one takes care of this; and for this reason, I make it clear to everyone that it is of great importance to know these things, although today many valiant young men and veteran men are found who are good and practical players, but they are not excellent for teaching, because they have not been raised with Masters who have equipped them to teach others, and for this reason, they err.

[455] (P178.S4)
Seeing such errors occurring, I have lovingly stirred myself in my intellect and art, to advise those who take delight in such virtue.

[456] (P178.S5)
Thus, reader who will read this, do not take offense, for I am certain that the slanderers and detractors of others' labors and virtues will strive to tarnish and completely erase the good reputation; nor will they seek to place these friends in their deserved position, like the valiant Captain S. Emilio Marscotto and Captain Gioan Maria Gabiato and Captain Battista Pellacano, along with many other knightly arms-bearers, who through my skill and their diligence are seen at the pinnacle of such noble art and glorious virtue, which, as freely given, they strive to exalt and magnify, as sincere and candid disciples of mine; and in all the places where they may be found, in my presence and absence, they will grant such honorable place as seems fitting to my ingenious labor; and even if they were to err in some part in their praises of me, this present work clearly demonstrates that they will not fall into error in all.

But know that if you wish to act against the said left-handed man, you will pass, finding him with the leg of his sword forward, with your right leg forward, somewhat towards his right side, and in this passing that you will make, you will thrust a false thrust into his face, above his sword; and he, seeing this, out of fear will push it outward towards your right side, and you seek this, to give him a straight thrust to his right leg from the sword, with a reverse together disordered, retreating back to his place with the said right leg, and in this way you will have returned to the guard of before; also to the said left-handed man you will thrust a point into his face, between the sword and his buckler towards his left side, passing at that time with your right leg forward; but know that he, out of fear of the said point, will cover the said left side, but the right will be uncovered and then you will give him a downward straight strike to the head that will fall into a high iron door; but if then he, the said left-handed man, responds to your right side, you will strike his blow outward and thus you will cut him straight in the face, increasing, if necessary, your left leg forward a little across; and from there you will make a great turn of the fist with your sword and will have returned to the long and high guard as before.

Being in a long and high tail, I want you to be patient, that is, you will give a little of the uncovered to the said left hand to your upper sides, so that he has cause to strike you with a thrust or a downward cut: to each of these blows you will appear to grow with your right leg with the shield, or the brocchiero, and you will give him a disordered downward cut to the head with a disordered upward cut, fleeing for your protection with your right leg back to the place where it was before, and there you will set yourself gallantly and neatly.

[477] (P183.S4)
But know that every time a left-handed person thrusts at you, you will simultaneously deliver a false straight from below upwards towards the hand of the sword, steady or you will pass your right leg across, towards your right side; and if he were to thrust at you with a false strike towards the hand, take it firmly with your shield and then, quickly passing with your right leg, thrust him in the face and there stop in that guard of long and narrow tail with your left foot close to the right, always pressing him with your low hand from the sword.

Now, having remained against the left-handed man in a long and narrow stance, I want you to maintain this order in this fourth and final part, that is, when you wish to strike when he does, if he strikes a straight thrust, you will counter with a reverse strike, always accompanying your hand with the sword and the shield or buckler that you will have in hand; but if he strikes a reverse, you will respond with a straight thrust always against him and proceed as I have told you, always covered; and if you do this, you will give him good account and he will never dare to strike.

And for this very practice that the left-handed person has in playing against a right-handed one, it seems to some that he has an advantage, and I say the opposite; therefore, take joy in this notion, for at present I do not wish to say more and I will conclude my discourse against the left-handed, making you understand that I have already covered what can be done against the right-handed, but for this fourth part, you shall be content for now.

Fighting from person to person with sword and grip, it is necessary that at the beginning, you position yourself in a long and high stance, with your weaker foot forward, holding your sword and grip together; but the tip of the said grip you will keep firmly extended towards the right of your enemy, and from here you will be patient in waiting for the enemy to strike first at you with a thrust or point or straight or reverse; now note that to all these blows that he throws at you, you will pass in that moment from your right leg towards his weaker legs and you will give him, in such passing, a thrust to the face or to the sides, and your weaker leg will follow the right to its place; and having done this, for your defense you will turn two steps towards his grip quickly and thus you will position yourself in a long and narrow stance, well polished and gallant.

You will push a reverse point from his right side, with your left leg passing forward; and immediately, having pushed the said reverse point, you will strike him with the quillons of your hilt strongly from underneath into that of the enemy, passing to give with the said hilt of your right leg strongly towards his left side; and in the moment of such passing, you will thrust a false thrust to the face, with a direct thrust together towards the legs, and your sword will lower to a wide iron gate, and the left leg will go behind the right to its place; and from the said wide iron gate, pulling your enemy to the upper part, you will defend yourself with a false passing of your left leg towards the right side of the enemy, and thus you will thrust your hilt into the arm of his sword, so that you will have the freedom to give him a direct thrust to the legs or a point to the flanks; and having done this, for your defense, you will strike him with a thrust using your hilt, and thus you will take two or three steps back as it seems and pleases you, and there you will settle in a long and high guard with the left foot well polished and fitted forward.

Being in a long and high guard, it is necessary to be patient here, for when your enemy strikes at your face with a thrust, you will deflect it with your hilt outward towards the side, passing in such a way that your strong right leg moves forward; and in this movement, you will throw your right hand onto your enemy's hilt, either with the pommel or by grasping it from above, and you will pull it strongly towards you, so that with little effort you will make him fall, for the point below will strike his weak leg at the shin, and in this way, he will not be able to remain on his feet; but beware that if he pulls back and you cannot execute the aforementioned grab, you will deliver a round backhand to his face with a straight cross, retreating your strong right leg behind your weak one, and then your weak leg behind your strong one; and there you will settle into a long and narrow guard, polished and gallant as much as possible.

You know that in the previous part you remained in a long and narrow tail: therefore from here you will be the first to strike, that is, you will deliver a thrust underhand to the face with your weak leg, passing forward from the right and indeed gathering it close to the said right; and in gathering the said leg you will bend the hilt, that is, from the middle downwards towards your right side, so that your weak leg will be uncovered: and I do this so that your enemy strikes you from the right or from the reverse towards your said leg; then, as he strikes you from the right or from the reverse, you will defend with your hilt, strongly extending it towards the ground, and in such a guard, you will pass your right leg forward towards his weak side and in such passing you will deliver a point to his right leg or to his face, strongly tightening the grip of your sword; but if it does not seem to you to give him the said point, you will give him a reverse thrust across his right arm and the weak leg will go to the usual place, straight to the right, and there you will turn cleanly and tightly towards your enemy's hilt, keeping his hand from the sword always with a bridge and better directed to his uncovered place, pirouetting a few times to regain your balance on the weak foot, following your enemy to whichever side he turns, and in this way you will refresh yourself whenever you please; keeping this order you will not tire yourself and you will be able to endure quite a lot with arms in hand.

[509] (P191.S3)
It must be understood that when you find yourself with the sword and the buckler or shield in hand against one who has a polearm, you will set yourself with your left leg forward, that is, in a long and high stance: and here it is necessary to be patient, always keeping your eye fixed on the blade of the enemy's weapon, for knowing that with polearms one does not strike except from the tip, either from above or below, therefore, when your enemy strikes you from one of the upper angles, you will pass your right leg towards the enemy's left side and thus you will deliver in that passing a diagonal strike to the upper side of his polearm, with a reverse round strike to the face, following your left leg to the right from behind; never abandoning your enemy if possible, soon you will throw your hand from your buckler to his polearm, expecting him; and not waiting for him, you will take two or three steps back and thus you will set yourself as I first told you, gallant and polished with your buckler or shield, tightly held together with the sword.

Now guard: with the point of the weapon raised, striking your enemy from above or below, you will defend yourself with your small shield or buckler, forcefully pushing outwards against the enemy's weapon towards their right side; and in such a thrust, you will pass your right leg towards the enemy's left side, and thus you will strike them with a thrust to the flanks, or you may choose a straight thrust to the head or the arms of the said enemy; and after delivering the said thrust or straight strike, for your defense, you will step back two or three paces and then you will set yourself anew with your left leg forward, still aligning your body as is customary; and from here in this third and final part that will follow, you shall be patient.

Notifying you that if by misfortune you were to come to blows, you on foot, with one who is on horseback, especially having the sword and the cloak, both disarmed and equal in arms, making you understand that by keeping the prescribed order you cannot fail, you will have honor, and therefore you will be attentive to what I will tell you; first, you will place your cloak on your left arm in such a way that you can throw it away, positioning yourself with your sword and the cloak in a high, well-polished iron guard; and from here, I want you, as the aforementioned horse comes at you, to wait for it and throw your cloak in the face of the aforementioned enemy's horse, passing, in such a throw, with your right leg towards its left side, giving it, in such a passing, a reverse strike to the legs in front of the aforementioned horse, with a forehand strike together across the reins or into the enemy's left leg, and your sword will lower into a wide iron guard; then, being in the said wide iron guard, you will throw yourself with your left leg towards the left side of the horse, and in this throw, you will seize the left rein and with the sword you will strike it a thrust to the flanks of him or the horse; for your defense, you will lift a thrust backward and position yourself with your sword in a long and high tail guard, understanding that if you do not take the said rein of the horse, because taking it you will never abandon it until you have either killed him or wounded him or the horse, in such a way that he cannot harm you, always attacking him or the said horse on his left side; letting you know that in these matters you need not fear anything and you will always be secure, always following his weak side, striking him and the said horse on the head or on the flanks or legs, letting you know that by giving one or two blows to the head of his horse or indeed to its legs, he will never be secure again to come against you; so that if you find yourself in such a conflict, you will go securely without fear, for having fear will not allow anything to be done that you desire, and by doing things carefully, it is almost impossible that you do not achieve what you want.

[522] (P194.S4)
Therefore, heed my counsel and do not think that I give you too many words, for I am a man of few words; and thus I shall conclude somewhat on this part of fighting from foot to horse.
