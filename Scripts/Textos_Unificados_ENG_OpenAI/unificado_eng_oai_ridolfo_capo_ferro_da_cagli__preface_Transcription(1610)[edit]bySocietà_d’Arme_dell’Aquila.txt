[8] (P1.S0)
[ i ] TO THE MOST SERENE LORD DON FRANCESCO MARIA FELTRIO DELLA ROVERE DUKE OF SESTO OF URBINO.

[9] (P1.S1)
The GNI Father (Most Serene Lord Duke) so that his sons may gain reputation, seeks for them some position in some noble Court, and provides them with the greatest protection he can.

[10] (P1.S2)
Thus I, finding myself with this present book of Teachings of Fencing, a part of the best of myself, seek to send it to Court, and because the parts of the intellect are dearer than any other, I beseech Your Excellency to grant it some place in your Court, which being a perfect compendium of the world, considered perfect, shows within itself all that is beautiful and good found in the world itself. And dedicating it to the Most Serene DON FEDERIGO, your Son, I commend it to his protection; who, although a child in swaddling clothes, plays and laughs, nonetheless seems to encompass within his hands triumphs and spoils, and, like a young Hercules, with a little hand, not yet equal to his desires, threatens the Hydra, slays the Serpents, since in his noble appearance shines forth the greatness of his ancestors, the magnanimity, the valor, and the countless other virtues that have wearied the greatest and most famous Historians, and which will render him, above every named Prince, and named and illustrious, to which eminence the sole virtues of A. would truly suffice.

[11] (P1.S3)
V. in number, and in quality so great that it can be directly called a diligent imitator of the perfection of GOD.

[12] (P1.S4)
Let not A. be astonished, therefore.

[13] (P1.S5)
V. If I desire to introduce into his Most Serene House, and to lean upon the protection of the Most Serene PRINCE, his Son, this my book, I beg his pardon for my boldness, considering the strength of paternal affection.

[14] (P1.S6)
I, certainly considering the singular kindness very proper to Your Excellency and to your Most Serene Blood, cannot help but firmly hope that the AA.

[15] (P1.S7)

[16] (P1.S8)
without regard for the lowliness of the subject, they will fully favor the most powerful support of theirs.

[17] (P1.S9)
But where it would not be fitting for Their Highnesses to receive such grace, such lowliness, may they at least (of which I humbly implore) allow me to remain in the public hall of their Royal Palace, and in the other public places of their vast Domain, for it would still be a great honor to be able to have a place among those who have humbly dedicated themselves to serve and revere Your Excellencies.

to which I pray from the Lord God for complete and eternal happiness.

[21] (P2.S0)
[ v ] TO THE BENIGN READERS RIDOLFO CAPO F. DA CAGLI.

[22] (P2.S1)
It is not my intention to keep you at bay with pompous and splendid words in recommending to you the profession of arms, which I practice.

[23] (P2.S2)
This, exalted to the proper degree of its merit, by itself is greatly esteemed and honored, and yet praises and commends the greatness and valor of those who worthily bear the sword at their side.

[24] (P2.S3)
Among whom, today gloriously shines the Most Illustrious Lord SILVIO PICCOLOMINI, Grand Prior of the Order of the Knights of Saint Stephen in Pisa, General of the Artillery, and Master of the Chamber of His Most Serene Highness, for he is not only equipped, fully and with marvelous advantage in this, the sword, but also in every other knightly art, as his heroic deeds beside the same, to the astonishment of all, soon manifest.

[25] (P2.S4)
But to return to the sword, I say it is the most noble weapon above all others, in whose handling the greater part of the skill of the art of fencing is honorably employed; for according to my judgment, merely bearing arms does not complete the task; and it is not what makes the essential difference between a truly valorous man and a vile coward, but rather the profession that one makes of knowing how to wield them valorously in legitimate defense of oneself and of one's homeland, which truly no one can do with honor unless he first humbles himself and submits to the laws and rules of the discipline of fencing; which, like a whetstone, sharpens and refines valor, bringing it to the height of its true perfection.

[26] (P2.S5)
Therefore, since this science is so commendable and so precious that it would be excessive, indeed a lost endeavor, to attempt to recount all its excellences, I do not believe that any reproach should fall upon me for having sought to condense it into the terms of certain brief, infallible, and well-ordered precepts, avoiding as much as possible the blind and obscure confusion, the deceptive and fallacious uncertainty, and the useless and ambitious prolixity.

[27] (P2.S6)
Now, just as I do not presume that the happiness of success has fully matched the fervor of my most ardent desire, due to my knowledge of my weak strengths, so I assure myself that my honest and heartfelt effort has not been in vain, as I compare myself to those who before me have dealt with the same subject.

[28] (P2.S7)
For this reason, trusting in the virtue of Him from whose favor all graces descend upon us, I firmly hope that from these my more faithful than apparent teachings, it may prove to be no less useful and delightful to you than to me, a small fragment of that sweet wisdom of true glory, which always pleases grateful souls to courteously offer to those who, with sincere hearts, are continually laboring in their honored services.
