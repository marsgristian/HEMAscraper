[1] (P124.S0)
[ 10v-a ] ¶ I am the first master and called remedy, for remedy is so much to say that knowing how to remedy that you are not given, and that you can give and wound your opponent in the image.

[2] (P124.S1)
For this, which cannot be done better, I will make your dagger go to the ground.

[3] (P124.S2)
Returning my hand to the left side.

[4] (P125.S0)
With my dagger, I will go around your arm once.

[5] (P125.S1)
And for this contrary, you will not have the dagger taken from me.

[6] (P125.S2)
¶ Even with this blow that I strike without doubt, I shall thrust it into your chest.

[7] (P126.S0)
In the middle bind, you should secure the arm in such a way that you cannot make any action against me.

[8] (P126.S1)
And if I want to throw you to the ground, it is of little concern to me.

[9] (P126.S2)
and to tire you out in no way.

[10] (P127.S0)
[ 10v-d ] ¶ The contrary of the play that is before me, I shall make you see to which side I have placed it.

[11] (P127.S1)
I will break his arm, or throw him to the ground instead.

[12] (P128.S0)
In good cover for the dagger in hand.

[13] (P128.S1)
Also, for such a grip, I could bind you well.

[14] (P128.S2)
And if I were to place my right hand under your right knee, I would make you fall to the ground, for I know how to do this art well.

[15] (P129.S0)
[ 11r-b ] ¶ The contrary of the play that is before me is to do.

[16] (P129.S1)
That you shall not be able to strike me to the ground, nor take my dagger, nor bind me.

[17] (P129.S2)
But you will gladly allow your misfortune,  
or my dagger will be swiftly sheathed.

[18] (P130.S0)
[ 11r-c ] ¶ This is a game without any contrary,  
And it is necessary that by force the player goes to the ground.

[19] (P130.S1)
And that I, for giving the dagger, the student as you see, that which I say to the player can do.

[20] (P130.S2)
And here, where the evening is in the land,  
another will be the end.

[21] (P131.S0)
[ 11r-d ] ¶ This play is little used in the art of the dagger, but for defense it is more wise, for the student with such a counter made in such a way, causes the player to be wounded either in the head or in the belly.

[22] (P132.S0)
[ 11v-a ] ¶ I am against the first King of the dagger called Remedy.

[23] (P132.S1)
He who knows how to remedy his own games, lets his weary hand take rest.

[24] (P132.S2)
And for such a grip that I can thrust the dagger into his back.

[25] (P136.S0)
[ 11v-b ] ¶ Here I am against the river of this first remedy of the dagger, for the grip that his student makes on me, in such a way I will wound him, and I will be compelled to let go.

[26] (P136.S1)
And if others wish to play with me, I shall do so without any delay.

[27] (P137.S0)
[ 11v-c ] ¶ This is a contrary that is not mine.

[28] (P137.S1)
Also the play of this counter that is above me, that is the second counter which has bound with his dagger the hand of the companion, who says that he can thrust the dagger into the back of the companion.

[29] (P137.S2)
And that is the play of him I make.

[30] (P137.S3)
¶ Although he spoke in the back.

[31] (P137.S4)
And I place it in my chest, and it is still its play for which I can do so.

[32] (P138.S0)
[ 11v-d ] ¶ I am a student of the first King and Remedy.

[33] (P138.S1)
And with this grip, I want to take the dagger from you and bind your arm.

[34] (P138.S2)
But I do not believe that you can do the opposite,  
And therefore I will do this for you without delay.

[35] (P139.S0)
[ 12r-a ] ¶ The opposite for this way I make you so that you do not take my dagger from me, nor bind my arm.

[36] (P139.S1)
And I and my dagger shall row in freedom.

[37] (P139.S2)
And then I will wound you in the letting go that you will make of me, in such a way and manner that you will have no defense.

[38] (P140.S0)
[ 12r-b ] ¶ This cover is called strong foot, and for this reason I make it to be able to perform several plays with it.

[39] (P140.S1)
And such strength cannot you annihilate me, for two arms can well withstand one.

[40] (P141.S0)
[ 12r-c ] ¶ This is the counter to this play which is called the strongest before.

[41] (P141.S1)
And I will turn it with my weary hand.

[42] (P141.S2)
Given him the turn to strike him does not fail me.

[43] (P142.S0)
For a good grip that I have made against you, it does not fail me that it does not break your arm upon my shoulder.

[44] (P142.S1)
And then with your dagger I can wound you, and this play is not to be missed.

[45] (P143.S0)
[ 12v-a ] ¶ For what you would wish to break the arm over your shoulder in the play that is before you, for that play I make this counter.

[46] (P143.S1)
For such strength, I will throw you to the ground, dead, so that you may never again do harm to me or others.

[47] (P144.S0)
[ 12v-b ] ¶ The dagger in your hand is well prepared.

[48] (P144.S1)
and I will thrust the point straight at your elbow.

[49] (P144.S2)
And that one for the deraii and struck you with her suddenly.

[50] (P144.S3)
For that 
I could not bend your arm, such a dagger 
I make for you.

[51] (P145.S0)
[ 12v-c ] ¶ I will do the opposite of the play that is before you, so that you do not take the dagger from me in such a manner.

[52] (P145.S1)
I will make my dagger hang, with my weary hand, I will let it go.

[53] (P145.S2)
and with the point I strike you with your own pain.

[54] (P146.S0)
In the land you must go entirely for defense, or else against me you will not be able to act.

[55] (P146.S1)
¶ And the dagger I will make you 
go far away, rather than I will take it in hand, 
for I know this art with every trick.

[56] (P147.S0)
[ 13r-a ] ¶ Thus it is said, now it has been done.

[57] (P147.S1)
I know the contrary of the scholar who is before me, who is a great fool, for he knows so well how to make my leg give way, and for this reason I put the dagger in his face, to show that he is mad and foolish.
