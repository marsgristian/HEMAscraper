[1] (P313.S0)
[ 16b-b ] We are two masters who await the art of lance, darts, and swords; little do we have to fear. And the defense that we make with the swords, we shall defend ourselves similarly with staffs. With steps and counters that we shall perform, we will use the narrow cuts and thrusts. And if it were public, that it may be good to announce, against us they could not have honor.
