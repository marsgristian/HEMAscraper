Prologue.

[3] (P1.S1)
Having already begun this small work of mine a long time ago, little adorned in truth, but, if I am not mistaken, very useful for what I orderly reason therein, regarding the advice and insights that arise in the handling of every kind of weapon, which things, although they have been found praiseworthy in every century, are indeed very much needed in our time due to the wretched use of them in the preservation of one's honor, it can be said that they are shown to be exceedingly necessary; having, I say, begun this work since my early youth, I have delayed until this my last age to give it its final completion and to send it forth for the common knowledge and utility of men, so that in it I might be entrusted not only with the things that were shown to me in this art by the most noble practitioner of it, Master Guido Antonio de Luca Bolognese, of whose school it can well be said that more warriors have emerged than were said to have come from the Trojan Horse, and all those that I had found poorly from any other source in every manner of appearing, which experience, the most certain proof of things, had confirmed to be very true on multiple occasions, which experience I say cannot come in a few years and is all the more required for this exercise than for any other, inasmuch as it is more dangerous than all the others and with it the gravest questions are determined among the greatest.

And although in pursuing this endeavor I have encountered many and many hardships due to the aforementioned reasons, I now find myself resolved, for I wish to dedicate it to some almost earthly deity, under whose favor I may safely, as they say, escape the envious bites and pass through the hands of men to future ages. It will not be a burden for me to labor too much in choosing to whom among many I should rather commit this, and it seems to many of those who have this to do that it should almost become customary, for to whom else could I more deserving send it than to You, Magnanimous and Magnificent Count Guido, who are not only of the most illustrious Rangona family, which has produced so many famous valiant men and the arms of Italy, but also of those of all Europe and of all Christian Chivalry, you are the true splendor and clarity, and of whom, oh more valorous Duke, or more wise Knight, for as long as I have lived, my eyes have yet to see.

[5] (P3.S0)
Of which I used to take the most certain argument and that thus it should bring forth the firmest hope ever since that time when under the teaching of the aforementioned Master Guido Antonio you began to undertake this most noble art, whose teachings you, having great need of your dignity, are exercising with your glory infinitely carried to the Stars. If I am not greatly mistaken, it should not be displeasing to you if I likewise render that honor which can be due to me to the greatest with the testimony of this little book, which I humbly implore you to receive courteously and directly in your kindness for many reasons, and by having it read, show that you do not disdain that with the memory of your gracious name and your glorious praises, which it bears on its front, it may gain goodwill among the diverse peoples and be read with some benefit, for you are truly the one who is more loved and revered by the most varied persons than anyone else, and to whom, beyond measure, everyone willingly recalls.

[6] (P4.S0)
Live happily and of Master Achille, the maker of this work, and to your chivalrous virtues, together with a generous spirit, be mindful at times.
