[1] (P22.S0)
[ 10v.3 ] Â¶ Reason of the half sword.

[2] (P22.S1)
Chapter X. As we proceed with this worthy work, it is necessary to declare, part by part, all the weapons of the art.

[3] (P22.S2)
To that which is well understood and adopted, Reason wishes that it first reveals to you the rotating principle of the sword.

[4] (P22.S3)
And with outstretched arms let him go, guiding the blade through the midst of the companion.

[5] (P22.S4)
And if you wish to appear great in the art, then you may go from guard to guard with a serene and measured hand, with steps that are not common.

[6] (P22.S5)
If you were to make any strike, do it with little turn before the face.

[7] (P22.S6)
Do not make it wide for long, for every wide time is indeed lost.

[8] (P22.S7)
And let the reverse then be of help to you, Passing off the path with the weary foot, Pulling the straight also, keeping the eye always on the good guard.

[9] (P22.S8)
When you wish to enter with the half-sword, as your companion raises his sword, then do not hesitate to take your time, for it may cost you dearly. Make sure you are in guard against the boar, when you enter with the point at the face. Do not linger at all, quickly turning the reverse cut, and strike straight, and let it be in your mind.

[10] (P22.S9)
So that you may understand my intention with clear reason, I hope to show you entirely the way.

[11] (P22.S10)
I do not want that in all it be pure reversed, nor shall it be a cut, but among the other and the one, let it be among that common, hammering the head on every side.

[12] (P22.S11)
Now I advise you, when you are engaged, That with your legs you position yourself properly: You will be Lord and clear In binding and striking boldly: And when you draw the reverse descending blow, Strike the weary knee and, note the writing, Extend the rear foot Without changing it to the other side.

[13] (P22.S12)
In the Lora, it is understood to be attacked The weary foot with the head now Because it is closer to it Than the straight one that runs across.

[14] (P22.S13)
To you, it is certain in every direction, and if you wish to deliver the straight downward strike, you must take the right knee: and extend well the tired one.

[15] (P22.S14)
C He would call the head attached also with the right foot that is closer to him: This is a better way than the walking of our ancestors.

[16] (P22.S15)
In the need that no one opposes or speaks, For you are stronger and more secure In the hard defense, And with a shorter time to wage war Than can make you fall to the ground.
