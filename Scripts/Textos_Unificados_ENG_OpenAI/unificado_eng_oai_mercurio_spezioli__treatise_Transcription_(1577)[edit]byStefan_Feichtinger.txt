[8] (P1.S0)
[ ii ] ILLUSTRIOUS.

[9] (P1.S1)
AND EXCELLENT.

[10] (P1.S2)
Lord and my most revered Master.

[11] (P1.S3)
AND HAVING been in Perugia for already two years, where Master Mercurio Spezioli, my dearest friend, was also present, he composed the following Chapter, on the manner of Fencing and Riding; and before I departed from there, having barely finished it, he favored me with a copy. Now, it has pleased our Lord God to call him to Himself, and I have deemed it right to publish this work of his to the world, both for the benefit of those who delight in such Virtues, and also to keep alive, in that part which I can, the name of such a Virtuous and dear friend.

[12] (P1.S4)
And because he has lived in the service of Your Most Illustrious Lordship since that time.

[13] (P1.S5)
& Excellent.

[14] (P1.S6)
Exercising the aforementioned Virtues, it has seemed fitting to present them to you, and on this occasion, to also offer you myself, assuring you that just as the vast sea of waters does not disdain to accept every little stream, no matter how small, so too will you not disdain me as your humblest servant.

[15] (P1.S7)
I shall serve you without fail, for I reverently admire you, and I observe the many and supreme Virtues and gifts with which Heaven has adorned you. With all reverence, I kiss your hands, praying to Our Lord God that He grants you every happiness.

[16] (P1.S8)
Of Your Most Illustrious Lordship.

[17] (P1.S9)
& Most Excellent.

[18] (P1.S10)
Humbly.

[19] (P1.S11)

[21] (P2.S0)
[ 1 ] CHAPTER ON FENCING AND RIDING.

[22] (P2.S1)
My lord, the sudden departure that you have made here from San Marino; has completely troubled my life.

[23] (P2.S2)
As I remain, I am like a poor man, Who for the love of God goes asking, At this Gate, and that for Bread, and Wine.

[24] (P2.S3)
Where with my thought so much wandering I have arrived at the Fountain of Helicon.

[25] (P2.S4)
Where the Muses have finally taken away my sword.

[26] (P2.S5)
And each one has taken me by the hair, And they have said to me they want to clarify Whether your art of arms is sad or good: Do not ever hope to leave here, Unless first you make clear and open, In what the art of Fencing consists; But if you do this, we grant you as a merit That you may wander freely Through any of our places, whether in plain or in steep; Without ever paying any toll, And we want that everything you say: No one among us shall have the right to judge.

[27] (P2.S6)
[2] So that I judged within myself that it was better for me to free myself from entanglement, thus in such words I began: "Gentle Muse, since I take pleasure in you, sit here around these little herbs while I seek the favor of Mars. Also pray to Apollo that I may not be deprived of the power to use words, whether they come forth troubled or clear. What I wish to say, let each one take note of, for this noble exercise of arms should be done in the world for two reasons; one is for honor, and not for vice, the other, from the first, derives glory, and the other serves each one more."

[28] (P2.S7)
This, at first, when it flourished in Rome, was the art of war, which everyone learned what was fitting for a good soldier.

[29] (P2.S8)
To offend and to defend he called it, but to do one without the other is not good; therefore, he who did more of it dominated more.

[30] (P2.S9)
Now to learn these, which are of such great benefit, four things are required, but first the heart must be good: judgment, a good eye, hand, and good foot. And to make the eye obey judgment, the hand can follow the eye, and to the hand the foot can follow: thus doing, there will be no one who fails, and not failing, one will never give time to his enemy to strike him.

[31] (P2.S10)
Now you will understand all the weapons, the substance with which one usually strikes, that is, cut, false, and point, if you do not know it.

[32] (P2.S11)
The cut is said to be the part of the weapons that faces towards the knots of the middle of the fingers, so as not to deceive.

[33] (P2.S12)
The false is that part, which in many ways is vainly struck, and lies hidden between the thumb and the more solid index.

[34] (P2.S13)
The point always hidden at the top, With which a man must make only the offense, Whether life is near or far away.

[35] (P2.S14)
With the cut, and the false one, defense is made, With the cut from the higher parts, With the false when they make the descending strikes.

[36] (P2.S15)
And to not speak any vain words, one can only strike in two ways: from the right and from the left with both hands.

[37] (P2.S16)
It should be said that it usually begins from the right side of the one who performs it, regardless of how it ends.

[38] (P2.S17)
The striking of the reverse changes state, always beginning from the left hand of the one who does it, but so many from every side.

[39] (P2.S18)
[ 4 ] Strikes are made, so that nothing is lacking With point, edge, and with the false as well With the right hand, or with the left hand.

[40] (P2.S19)
The day of the right strike I wish to describe now, also to offend from within is called, that of the reverse to offend from without.

[41] (P2.S20)
Now from the beginning to the honored scheme, saying that with the cut one can make twelve strikes, and that these are called.

[42] (P2.S21)
The right hand, a thrust, and it should begin at the adversary's weary shoulder and end at the right knee. The right hand, round, goes from the left hand of the enemy and finishes at his right shoulder; another is missing, a straight descending strike, which comes from the right hand through the middle of the head and between the feet of the enemy, it comes in a straight line.

[43] (P2.S22)
Mounting from the right, you see the adversary's weary knee. Then, rising from the right side, you strike. There is another that is also called mounting straight descending, which is done solely from the right hand, and both sides, coming from the feet to the head, go. Then the downward strike from the right is usually made. Now pay attention here to how it is done: the descending strike from the right usually falls toward the ground, and then from false upward, in reverse from the angle, and then it is to be avoided.

[44] (P2.S23)
Come from the side, slanting downwards. Pay close attention, for this is better than the other strikes, and it is also more useful.

[45] (P2.S24)
Now I wish to show you if it does not hurt my heart to speak of the other six strikes from the reverse, which come from the opposite side, from the outside; and thus it is made with a mistake, a reverse that begins from the right shoulder of the enemy and goes towards the opposite knee.

[46] (P2.S25)
There is a round reverse that I tell you begins with the right hand, ending with the left hand, and I repeat that whoever wishes to make the descending reverse must do so through the head in the right style; yet it is necessary to begin from the outside, for if one and the other were to do similarly, there would be no difference between them, as they would make a similar motion.

[47] (P2.S26)
The mountain roughness descends from the one of the straight knees of the opponent, rising to the weary side towards the Moon.

[48] (P2.S27)
A descending strike from the outside, and varied: For it begins low, and then goes straight, Through the middle of the face of the opponent. The reverse tramazzon, if well executed, Will be better made with the art; With time, both will yield profit.

[49] (P2.S28)
With the straight cut, you descend to the part near the foot, and then with a false straight, you rise, to the pure straight part, also making a false cut with your right hand. And because these are also better, turn the fist, and let the arm remain firm.

[50] (P2.S29)
With these, both inside and outside, one takes the advantage from which great fruits come forth, if these are flowers.

[51] (P2.S30)
Thus, sounding Muses appear to you.

[52] (P2.S31)
We have satisfied the proposal that was already made to us from the beginning.

[53] (P2.S32)
And that we can turn at our leisure To find her dressed in black, Who has been distant from us for so long. Calliope placed her finger to her mouth And then said to Terpsichore and Thalia, "Oh, let him be mocked, or this man is dazed; He does not remember in the discourse That we have previously been named The cut, and the false with the wicked point."

[54] (P2.S33)
Wherefore I ask for pardon, ingeniously, I say that this proceeds from Love, who, only thinking of him, made me forget: And wishing to support with an author from sacred scripture that beautiful passage which poorly serves more than one Lord; They whispered in a low tone, "Let us forgive this one with such a pact that he return to the abandoned passage, and that for penance of such evil, with great swearing, we make him obliged in such a way; that henceforth he be content to make known to us every important advice in this noble art."

[55] (P2.S34)
So that, weeping, I was drawn aside, not knowing to take any remedy; I entrusted myself only to God Mars.

[56] (P2.S35)
Asking that he forgive me (Promising for me) the error I have made, That as it pleased them I wished to observe, From whence he emerged from that hollow forge Of the smith Vulcan, with Venus and Cupid alongside him.

[57] (P2.S36)
All three took me by the hand and led me where the Muses were, to the sweet murmuring, soft and gentle.

[58] (P2.S37)
Offering my due apologies to beautiful Venus, and her son Cupid, remaining all intent with closed mouths, saying this is that most faithful servant of my dear lover who has followed him for many years through mountain and shore.

[59] (P2.S38)
And if I with my son the first years Had not already climbed through his deeds Near to the high seats.

[60] (P2.S39)
For whom this deed so bold has sought to contest with my son for five lustra, and the sixth not yet completed.

[61] (P2.S40)
Operating the art of defense only in such a time, and it would be defended even more, of which I disdain the flight.

[62] (P2.S41)
I made my way to the sweet swans, and stretched that I had a noose of hair loaded. I withdrew, and I saw Cupid suspended, holding the arrows and the bow, pretending to strike him now high, now low, now within, now without, yet he never found the opening.

[63] (P2.S42)
Because he stood firm with a step neither long nor wide, and he was solely intent on not erring, and he took hold of the step.

[64] (P2.S43)
Now while my son was turning the round, and this sun, turning, gave one of its feet into the trap that lay hidden.

[65] (P2.S44)
And he fell unwrapped, and I believed you. I told you that you could contend with me. You know well that I am not a boy, as you see.

[66] (P2.S45)
[9] Therefore he said, "Now I want to yield to you and to your sex, but not to your son, nor to those who are of his kind."

[67] (P2.S46)
Cupid then wanted to take hold of him, and I said to him, "Not that he is my prisoner," and thus I freed him from such peril.

[68] (P2.S47)
Wherefore, for such an occasion, this man has devotedly served me, putting his art into oblivion.

[69] (P2.S48)
So, my dear Muses, he has failed this time; I ask you to forgive him, and even more so because he is repentant.

[70] (P2.S49)
Do it, I beg you, do it if you love me, for I will receive it as a great favor, and I will keep it in mind for the days to come.

[71] (P2.S50)
I want you to also grant him a favor that mounts upon the Pegasus horse, which makes this art also gift the heart.

[72] (P2.S51)
And I assure you that he will not fail beneath him who corrects him in time, and then he will assist him with his interval.

[73] (P2.S52)
And in such a manner was the contest made between him and the Muses, and with a light leap he mounted upon the horse that does not bend.

[74] (P2.S53)
But first you want to see how it is necessary that the bridle stands in its proper place and that the swans perform their duty.

[75] (P2.S54)
[10] Mars, who willingly gazes upon such sport, Placed in his hand the sharp spurs, Made and tempered by Vulcan in the fire, Which his sweet lover had given him, perfect and good, Having stolen them from her lame husband While he was making thunder.

[76] (P2.S55)
Thus he, seeing himself equipped with what was necessary, that even Cupid, by the rod of one of his arrows, had served at the beck of her who was adored in Paphos and in Gnidos, for he would always have held her as his treacherous enemy in eternal conflict; in this, the heavenly will also concurred, having the name of one of his sons as well; and thus these two made peace.

[77] (P2.S56)
Which then, having been done, being near the Muse with the Gods on the right side in a place remained, then Venus said to him: "Now, if you are as I have said to these, doing what you must, giving beginning to that which you shall do." Whence he, having adjusted his stirrups and his garments, moved with such grace in his walking.

[78] (P2.S57)
Then with elevated steps, and more eminent, with a loose trot, and with vigorous gallop, and in running behind, he lets the winds go.

[79] (P2.S58)
[11] Then with leaps he shows a grouped Pardo, with kicks, or without, making him stop lightly or slowly.

[80] (P2.S59)
And then, when he begins to handle, quickly and securely on one side and the other, now with the full turn, now with the middle, now against time, now with time he shares.

[81] (P2.S60)
The halfway time, and at the right time the weights With Capriol that astonishes Mars.

[82] (P2.S61)
And if such a turn is out of the footsteps, by chance it escapes quickly corrected, it comes against the thrusts.

[83] (P2.S62)
hand, voice, bridle, stirrups, flesh, and spurs.

[84] (P2.S63)
So that the docile animal is compelled, feeling also the aid of the hand, and of the other five to play deftly and clearly, now it turns from one side with the right hand always raised, and with the left spur, at the right moment, it strikes until the hand is changed.

[85] (P2.S64)
As soon as the right spur is felt, one immediately raises the weary hand towards where you see it turn.

[86] (P2.S65)
Before going back, to the right hand, to the left hand, It makes one walk so rightly, either slowly or swiftly, now low, now high, that nothing is lacking.

[87] (P2.S66)
Then he strikes, and with a more fearsome voice, he makes it rise into the air with a step and a leap, with kicks, or without, so that he appears more ferocious.

[88] (P2.S67)
[12] Then at a gallop he makes it turn high, In a circle with one hand and the other, Which makes it double in step and leap. Then he brings it back so straight and smooth That he makes it double, now low to the ground, Now low, now high with one hand and the other.

[89] (P2.S68)
Do not think, however, that this one errs In punishment, in aid, and still in time He caresses him, and holds him firm to the ground To make him regain all in one hour The strength lost through continuous motion He removes the sweat from his hand.

[90] (P2.S69)
Now, appearing to all, this man's valor made them joyful and content, they signaled for him to cease his movement.

[91] (P2.S70)
Then, at the murmuring with sweet tones, they all turned towards the fountain, and there they were intent on dismounting.

[92] (P2.S71)
What has arrived with a high-pitched voice says: Gentlemen, I am that poor fellow who lost his way to this fountain.

[93] (P2.S72)
No longer shall all rest, you are the one. We recognize you one by one, and we accept you as a son and as a brother.

[94] (P2.S73)
And we shall make for you faith each one To whom it may concern, who wishes to know, That there is no other like you under the moon.

[95] (P2.S74)
[ 13 ] Because both of these arts possess something that until now has not been seen, and we do not believe that it can be seen.

[96] (P2.S75)
But in truth you gain so little from it and value it so little, and you make it a part both for a good one and for a wicked one.

[97] (P2.S76)
And because you do not teach them with art As others do, sometimes pretending And often well, they do not wish to pay you.

[98] (P2.S77)
And thus, to enrich the way, you are taken; And you shall always remain a little poor. Behold your strength, for now it has turned back.

[99] (P2.S78)
He replied; I know indeed the truth more than you say, and in this matter of having the wrong, I submit myself.

[100] (P2.S79)
And I say to avoid quarrels and disputes that I have always practiced this profession of not valuing either gold or pearls.

[101] (P2.S80)
And thus I have lived freely, and such I hope to die, nor am I greedy, and I delight in playing checkmate more than any other game, and I hold it dear above all else.

[102] (P2.S81)
To serve others, rather than to receive, although I often learn at my own expense.

[103] (P2.S82)
And if this seems strong to others to believe, I care little who believes it, And if it pleases someone, I wish to keep silent; It is enough for me that I do not yield in courtesy To anyone, even if I am soon rich To so many, and so many, and I know from where it proceeds.

[104] (P2.S83)
I will say that virtue does not value less the reward, and he who esteems it then does not sell it, but gives it out of kindness.

[105] (P2.S84)
And from this comes that many among us learn little, and it consumes our years and our money, and then they repent. Therefore, Cupid, return to me my wings so that I may ascend with the work where those of sublime rank occupy their thrones.

[106] (P2.S85)
And you, mother of Love, pious Venus, since I am your prisoner, set me free, or make my mistress less cruel.

[107] (P2.S86)
O you of the fifth Heaven, grant me such strength that without fail, and without another mistress, you may quietly lead me to the end of my feeble years. Never think that I abandon you, for though weak I cannot follow at your feet, I have no one else who gives me horses.

[108] (P2.S87)
I shall never be so base of spirit, and shaken, That with my mind I do not always strive To make you receive as much honor as I can. And if others do not care for my virtues, I shall care less for their money, And yet I shall live with my hard fortune. Grant me grace, Lord, that those who are wealthy Shall be towards me, even if I teach them With such pure faith, that they learn less. It is now time to bring my past wood Into the port, and to weave the crafted cloth, Having given my faith as a pledge.

[109] (P2.S88)
So that I do not appear false with the sail inflated with falsehoods, I come to speak again, since there is nothing left that conceals it from me.

[110] (P2.S89)
Thus, Muses, you have to remind me that I, interlacing the false strikes, you all have to ask me to speak therefore of the false strikes. There are twelve, just like the cuts, which are the opposite of their own false.

[111] (P2.S90)
Do so all of them that, starting with the edge, go until their end; returning backward will be false, and not an edge.

[112] (P2.S91)
Whoever wishes to understand better, let them incline their ears, for I want to show it more clearly and openly. They are like the rose upon the thorns, which from the right hand deviates with effect. The false comes from the reverse deviation, returning by its own path, this is certain. And likewise from the reverse deviation, returning still by the same way, there comes yet from the right a false deviation. And to not make a long discourse, with the firm fist where it descends, and where it ascends, it falls to the place before. Now I am left to strike only with the point, for it too shall be counted as twelve, as it seems to compare in only two ways: with the closed fist, either firm or turned inward, outward, and three are made from the right, three others from the reverse according to my dictation. One from high to low, and great profit, for it does, but does not succeed for everyone. I have proven it, and therefore I have written it here. The other comes from the middle air, used commonly; the other comes from low to high, and it seems, and is quicker, and convenient for each one. Three others from the reverse can be made, both one and the other, from inside and outside, firm and turned, to reach twelve.

[113] (P2.S92)
And of my courtesy I wish to tell you again That there are thirty-six strikes as I hear With edge, and false, and with the point that goes out.

[114] (P2.S93)
They cannot be done in any other way than those I have mentioned, unless they wish to chase carrots, deceitfully.

[115] (P2.S94)
Now I will come a little closer to the point, giving some good advice from which the useful is effectively derived.

[116] (P2.S95)
[ 17 ] Beginning with good foundation I say that this strike is the best That is most convenient and quick, or what argument That can be resolved with reason no author Could ever; for it is so in effect Therefore keep it in mind, oh good reader.

[117] (P2.S96)
Next, I wish you to know for certain that there are two advantages that nature grants to each one, but not for their own merit.

[118] (P2.S97)
To be great and strong; to whom more care, And more esteem should be given in my opinion Because by being above one endures more, And also this shall be a common opinion That the advantage of arms alone is To be above, and even when one is struck.

[119] (P2.S98)
But arms accompanied will better be The staying below, for that sword More swiftly finds the way to strike Yet does not fall upon any in spirit That alone suffices to have these advantages From nature, which without art is nothing And in this, this art is held by the wise That only the time, and this time is solely To offend, and to evade its troubles In this, man should rise to flight As high as he can with judgment Nor ever do otherwise, being this alone From which honor and utility have their beginning The rest being vanity of the world That is, guards and strikes made without judgment.

[120] (P2.S99)
Now I tell you with joyful speech, Leave these things, and return to the time, For this art can make you fruitful.

[121] (P2.S100)
And if such exercise you love, Pay careful attention to the four errors That people make in their encounters. Above, below, they are within and without, As I seem to have narrated above. Do not let your hearts be entangled in another, If the time from high to low is given to you. From above, you must strike; If from below to high, let it be thwarted.

[122] (P2.S101)
When you see an attack coming from within, strike with the swiftest offense from inside. If you are outside, you must prevent the attack from outside. If you seek the advantage of the grip, if the enemy presents his right side to you, strike down with your left hand, and his sword will be suspended above, and crossed. With your left foot, you will meet his right foot, and your weapon will be below, at his side.

[123] (P2.S102)
Having first taken hold with the left hand of the hilt of his sword, so that the time may not be altered, and if by chance he were to take one or two steps back, do not fail to follow him, so that you may not lose your advantage.

[124] (P2.S103)
And if you wish to turn him, stop him If he goes with a weary hand, and you always with the right hand, And conversely, always go to meet him When he attacks from the right side. It is said that then the advantage will be To he who has the fist higher, and he who has the edge of his blade upright, And above it should be Turned towards the point that is adverse But let the point stay at his shoulder.

[125] (P2.S104)
When the offense is repelled from outside, the advantage will be the lower fist, in the said manner, and it will not be a wasted effort.

[126] (P2.S105)
Stasis is warned in changing the step, either one or the other, forward or backward, that within or without one can make a weak move.

[127] (P2.S106)
If you arrive, oh, this is a fine secret that is very important to not strike in vain; if you arrive, strike, and remain with a quiet step.

[128] (P2.S107)
Take care also in the turning of the hand in all four of the aforementioned ways, and the same arm shall not be in vain.

[129] (P2.S108)
These are truths, they are not deceits; For deceits are like the feints That harm, and do not aid as hatred. And if you give yourself to your thrusts, Whether of cut, false, or point, and let the blade be high to the face that is within you, If the prescribed strike is to be delivered from behind.

[130] (P2.S109)
Make sure that your left hand is extended towards the enemy to whom it will be a great displeasure. This you shall observe even if your hand is weary. You will hold other weapons for defense or offense, for a good habit grows and does not fail. And whoever wishes to engage in a contest with a Left-handed man must always stay above with your weapons, which is a good investment.

[131] (P2.S110)
But one who does not wish to always wait, for in doing so one makes an error, must change desires and alter temperament. He must be wary, as one who has heart; if he is cowardly, whether he knows or does not know, let him proceed cautiously, and restrain and endure his own worth.

[132] (P2.S111)
And be on guard, when you see him strike with fury, and quickly firm your hand with the defense, or let him always yield with his advantage, and if he were to move away, or to one side, you should always follow him deftly and quietly.

[133] (P2.S112)
Without so much as a single time being caught in one of the errors made in practice, with a false cut, or with the point you shall have given.

[134] (P2.S113)
And if he then stops, and is either high or low in a strange manner, do not be dismayed, for I will tell you now.

[135] (P2.S114)
One should not proceed as before, which is called voluntary time, spoken of as errors that lead one forward.

[136] (P2.S115)
You shall proceed with the necessary time,  
As one with very mature judgment,  
For it forces an error upon the adversary.  
To proceed in this time is more secure,  
Though indeed it is more difficult in effect,  
For one must remain patient and steadfast.

[137] (P2.S116)
And to attempt the enemy circumspectly From all sides, and if you make the first offense, Immediately I await your defense. In this time much value is placed On the strong, and the weak strike To seize the advantages mentioned before. It is also necessary that you know with reason What part of the sword is strong And which is weak by comparison. I will tell you this so as not to keep you on guard: From the middle towards the tip, the weak will be, More towards the hilt the strong seems to go; And if you wish to act according to my fancy In the offenses and defenses you will make, Ensure that they are always done with the strong. And thus, being careful, you will not be able To do anything but well, and have patience If you wish to proceed in this time.

[138] (P2.S117)
Now, my lords, in good conscience, tell me if you think I have satisfied you, and if such is the case, grant me leave.

[139] (P2.S118)
That I am awaited, and as a sign all at once Make with your hands a gesture, and applaud So that I too shall go content, and satisfied To find her whom you know.

[140] (P2.S119)
THE END.
