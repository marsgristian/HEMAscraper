[1] (P0.S0)
[Title] NEW AND BRIEF METHOD OF FENCING BY ALFONSO FALLOPPIA OF LUCCA, Standard-Bearer in the Fortress of Bergamo.

[2] (P0.S1)
TO THE MOST ILLUSTRIOUS AND EXCELLENT.

[3] (P0.S2)
YOUR LORDSHIP, THE SIR.

[4] (P0.S3)
RAINVTIO FARNESE Prince of Parma.

[5] (P0.S4)
With the permission of the Superiors IN BERGAMO Ⅿ Ⅾ ⅬⅩⅩⅩⅡⅡ At the hands of Comin Ventura.

[6] (P1.S0)
[ 1 ] MOST ILLUSTRIOUS AND EXCEEDINGLY NOBLE My Lord.

[7] (P1.S1)
Desiring to make myself known to the world as a most devoted servant of Your Excellency, and thus as a new deer, who bears not the name of Caesar upon his brow, but that of Rainutio Farnese, to be respected wherever I may be found; I have not known how to do this better than by dedicating to you this my chivalric work, composed for the universal benefit of gallant men, and for the confusion of those fencers who either do not practice or do not wish to teach anything but certain things that nature teaches by itself; and even these, with a negotiated price, as is done with mechanics.

[8] (P1.S2)
I spoke of chivalry, in distinction from those who teach deceit and treachery, and are not ashamed to propose weapons that are never seen except in calculated cases and manifest assassinations, such as wheels, shields, bucklers, iron balls, great swords, and weapons of any name or kind; all of which I wish to keep far from me; for by such a name I do not intend to include any other sort of weapon than those proper both for defense and for offense, which are commonly carried every day by all; namely, sword, dagger, mail, and cloak (which for now it is permissible to consider as a weapon for defense).

[9] (P1.S3)
Of these alone, therefore, it is my intention to treat, as those that are suitable for every gentleman, and of which a soldier and a person of honor ought to make a profession: And I shall be so brief that I will reduce everything to seven guards, or rules, which it is fitting to speak of; of which three will pertain to the sword alone, one concerning cloak and sword; and the other three will be for the dagger and sword: Nor shall I be lacking in any matter; for in these seven will be gathered those of each and every other.

[10] (P1.S4)
I will still be easy in such a way that without figures I shall be understood.

[11] (P1.S5)
As for the utility of this art, which pertains to the preservation of honor and life, there is none who does not know it. Therefore, may it please Your Excellency to appreciate it, not because it may benefit princes equal to yourselves who are defended by their own authority; but because it will ever bear eternal witness to my devotion and service towards your most fortunate and exalted house.
