[1] (P187.S0)
[ 16r-a ] ¶ This Master that I speak of says that this cover is fine in arms and without arms.

[2] (P187.S1)
And with such a cover I can cover in every part.

[3] (P187.S2)
And to enter into all bindings.

[4] (P187.S3)
And to take and to wound according to [169] that my students shall come to strike to the end.

[5] (P187.S4)
And let this cover be made by each of my students.

[6] (P187.S5)
And then make the games straight that can be done.

[7] (P188.S0)
[ 16r-b ] ¶ I have made the cover of the Sixth Master who gives me in this.

[8] (P188.S1)
And immediately I made this grip to strike you, which I can do.

[9] (P188.S2)
And with the dagger held crooked, it does not stain my hand in such a way that I tire my hand.

[10] (P188.S3)
I can still bind you in the ligature.

[11] (P188.S4)
the middle that is the third play of the first Master shows the remedy of the dagger.

[12] (P188.S5)
You could still perform other plays, without abandoning my dagger.

[13] (P189.S0)
[ 16r-c ] ¶ Half a turn is made while holding the cover of my Master Sesto.

[14] (P189.S1)
And to wound you has been done quickly.

[15] (P189.S2)
And if you were armed, I would care little for you, for this dagger would find its way to your face with precision.

[16] (P189.S3)
Although I strike you in the chest, for you are not armed, nor do you know the close play.

[17] (P190.S0)
[ 16r-d ] ¶ Of the Sixth, my Master, do not abandon the cover.

[18] (P190.S1)
I turned my weary arm over your right.

[19] (P190.S2)
And agreeing the right foot with the tired arm, turns in a dome to the opposite side.

[20] (P190.S3)
You are, half bound, and your dagger  
you can say I have soon lost it.

[21] (P190.S4)
And this play I make so suddenly that I do not fear the contrary, nor do I have doubt.

[22] (P191.S0)
[ 16v-a ] ¶ Having made the cover of my Master, I have made this grip.

[23] (P191.S1)
Armed and unarmed, I can wound you.

[24] (P191.S2)
And I can also place you in the upper bind of the first scholar of the fourth Master, remedy of the dagger.

[25] (P192.S0)
[ 16v-b ] ¶ Not abandoning the cover of Master Sesto, I do this this time.

[26] (P192.S1)
Your right hand is for losing the dagger, and see that you overturn it; mine will immediately wound you, and your dagger will be lost to you.

[27] (P192.S2)
Yet, perhaps with my weary arm, I can make you struggle in the binding of the soutane.

[28] (P193.S0)
[ 16v-d ] ¶ Here is placed the counter to the Sixth play. I wish to reason before him, for I am his only student, and this play is his, of Master Sextus.

[29] (P193.S1)
And this play in arms is worth more than without arms, for this fierce one in hand, for in that place one cannot be well armed.

[30] (P193.S2)
For if one is unarmed, he would seek to strike him in the face or in the chest.

[31] (P193.S3)
Or in a place where it would weigh upon them.

[32] (P194.S0)
[ 16v-c ] ¶ I do the opposite of the Sixth King, thinking that with your cubit I will make your person turn, and in that I can strike you.

[33] (P194.S1)
For this thought that you will soon make, many tight plays can be defended.

[34] (P194.S2)
And primarily against him, he took from the close play.
