[1] (P0.S0)
[ 2r ] To the Most Illustrious LORD,  
Lord Count Fabio Pepoli, Count of Castiglione, my Lord, and ever gracious patron.

[2] (P0.S1)
Having known that Your Illustrious Lordship has delighted greatly in the virtues that pertain to an honored Knight since your tender years; and the spirit I have always had to serve you and to do something pleasing for you; has made me desire more than once to be able to show you some sign of it.

[3] (P0.S2)
However, having now decided to bring this work to light; I have concluded that it should carry with it the honorable name of your Illustrious Lady.

[4] (P0.S3)
Thus, I present this law, not to equal with this humble gift the debt I owe to you, for my weak powers do not extend so far, but to leave you some testimony of my loving servitude.

[5] (P0.S4)
where I humbly beseech Your Illustrious Lordship to accept it graciously, and with the usual courtesy, which I have always known in the singular goodness of your spirit.

[6] (P0.S5)
that I shall impose this obligation, alongside the countless others that I hold with her.

[7] (P0.S6)
And with a humble kiss to Your Illustrious Lordship's hand; I pray our Lord God to graciously grant you the fulfillment of all your desires.

[8] (P0.S7)
To Your Illustrious Lordship, Most Affectionate Servant, Giovanni dall'Agocchie.

[ 3r ] PROLOGUE OF MASTER GIOVANNI DALL'AGOCCHIE FROM BOLOGNA,  
On his book of the art of Fencing.

[10] (P1.S1)
I have always esteemed it a praiseworthy thing to assist and benefit others: This consideration has led me to resolve to condense into a brief treatise what I have been able to learn and experience over many years regarding both the science and practice of the art of fencing.

[11] (P1.S2)
Nor has the sight of many excellent men having extensively written on this matter been able to deter me from this my intention; both because such men have omitted certain things, perhaps some of the most important to know; and also because, this art being difficult to describe in a way that it is well understood, it is treated anew each time more to illuminate it.

[12] (P1.S3)
Therefore, to be the Shield the main part of military exercises; it is seen that it is exceedingly necessary for men: considering that if in times of peace we must not remain idle, and in times of war we wish to have the use of it; what could be more fitting for us than this?

[13] (P1.S4)
And among the bodily exercises, which is the most noble and the most illustrious of them all?

[14] (P1.S5)
But if then in the accidents of war a man is compelled and forced to exercise himself, what then is the reason that each one does not seek to have complete knowledge of this beautiful and useful profession?

[15] (P1.S6)
I remain silent about those abatements of honor, which are called duels: in which no one can honorably appear, who is entirely ignorant of this.

[16] (P1.S7)
For which reason I do not consider it useless that these my discourses may come to fruition: which I have composed in the form of a dialogue for the easier understanding of those to whom they will come; I have arranged them in such a manner that last summer I had a discussion in Brescia, at the house of the Most Illustrious Lord Girolamo Martimenghi, with Messer Lepido Ranier, a young man of keen and virtuous manners and very knowledgeable in the art of fencing: with whom, after many discussions, we both being reduced to the garden; he thus began to speak.
