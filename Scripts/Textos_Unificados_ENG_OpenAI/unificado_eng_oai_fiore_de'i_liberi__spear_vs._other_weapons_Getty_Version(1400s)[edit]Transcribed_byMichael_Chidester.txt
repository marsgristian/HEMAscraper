[1] (P370.S0)
[31r-c] ¶ This master awaits these two with their lances, the first to thrust with the point above the hand, and the other to thrust below the hand.

[2] (P370.S1)
this is seen.

[3] (P370.S2)
The master waits with the staff and with the dagger, when one of these tries to strike him with his lance, the master bends the staff towards the right side, almost in the entire iron door, turning the person, not moving his feet from the ground.

[4] (P370.S3)
And the master remains in guard.

[5] (P370.S4)
And as one of these comes in, he parries his lance with the staff, and with the dagger he engages when the hand is weary, and with that parry he passes and strikes fiercely.

[6] (P370.S5)
And this is its defense as you will find above these two of the lances.

[7] (P371.S0)
[ 31v-a ] ¶ This is the game of the master who awaits those two with two lances.

[8] (P371.S1)
The master stands with the right hand holding a dagger, and in the left hand he holds the staff upright.

[9] (P371.S2)
before you.

[10] (P371.S3)
[384] This can be done in this manner of play.

[11] (P371.S4)
And I do it for him in exchange.

[12] (P371.S5)
But if this player had known how to properly execute this thrust of the dagger, he could have well avoided it. If he had released the hands of the lance, and with the advance of the lance that comes straight, he had covered beneath my dagger, he would not have been caught in this way.

[13] (P371.S6)
And if with his lance he could harm me, then such a counter I would have known how to make.

[14] (P372.S0)
[ 31v-b ] ¶ This master will defend himself with these [385] two sticks against the spear in such a way that when the spear is near to thrust, the master with his right hand will place the stick against the head of the spear.

[15] (P372.S1)
And immediately with one stick, he goes with the other stick to the cover of the spear, and with his dagger, he strikes him in the chest, following where he is dependent on this side.

[16] (P373.S0)
[ 31v-c ] ¶ I do the aforementioned of the master here before.

[17] (P373.S1)
If he had known the contrary, he would have made me pay in such a way.

[18] (P373.S2)
To have taken the hands with your spear under my dagger.

[19] (P373.S3)
And thus you would have me possessed to ruin.

[20] (P373.S4)
Having this, that you know not how to do anything.

[21] (P374.S0)
[ 46r-a ] ¶ Here are three companions who wish to assist this master.

[22] (P374.S1)
The first one wishes to strike me under the arm while carrying his lance at half-length. The second carries his lance at full length. The third wishes to thrust at me with his lance.

[23] (P374.S2)
And it is agreed that no one should make more than one strike per man, although they should do so one at a time.

[24] (P375.S0)
[ 46r-c ] ¶ This is the play of the master, which before he awaits with the spear, he makes those on horseback enter into the game of the wild boar, passing off the road and countering, so that he brings them into this play.

[25] (P375.S1)
And for this to be understood, I do it in his place, for with my cut and point I can strike him in the head. Thus I carry my spear well ready.

[26] (P376.S0)
[ 46r-d ] ¶ And here is this play of the right hand, which is before in the guard of the boar's tooth; in its exchange, I do this that he can do.

[27] (P376.S1)
When the lance is parried, I turn my lance, and thus I strike with the fierce blow that this iron is tempered and of all excellence.
