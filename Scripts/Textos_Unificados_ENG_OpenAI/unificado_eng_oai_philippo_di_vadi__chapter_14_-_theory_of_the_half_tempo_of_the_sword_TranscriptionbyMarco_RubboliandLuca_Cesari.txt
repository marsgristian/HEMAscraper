[1] (P26.S0)
[ 13v.1 ] Â¶ Reason of the middle time of the sword.

[2] (P26.S1)
Chapter XIV.

[3] (P26.S2)
I cannot, while writing, show you the reason and the method of the middle time, for it would be too brief in the knot of time and its drawing.

[4] (P26.S3)
And the half time is only one turning of the knot: quickly, and suddenly to the striking.

[5] (P26.S4)
It is rare to fail when it is done with good measure; And if you note my writing, he who lacks practice separates poorly: Often the flying blade breaks with a good edge the brain of another.

[6] (P26.S5)

[7] (P26.S6)
