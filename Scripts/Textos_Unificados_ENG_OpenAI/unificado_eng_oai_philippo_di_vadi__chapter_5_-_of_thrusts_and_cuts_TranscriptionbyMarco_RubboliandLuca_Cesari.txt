[ 9r.2 ] Â¶ Of Points and Cuts Chapter V.

[2] (P17.S1)
The sword is a point with two edges,  
But well note and understand this writing,  
So that your memory does not falter:  
The One is the false and the other is the true,  
And reason commands and wishes that you keep this firmly in your mind.  
The true with the true together take,  
The reverse with the false together be,  
Except for the downward strike, the true wishes.  
Understand well my writing:  
Seven strikes are that which the sword delivers,  
Six edges with the point that serves,  
So that you may find this vein:  
Two above and below, and two in the middle,  
The point in the center with trickery and pain,  
For our air often makes it serene.
