[1] (P15.S0)
[ 4v.3 ] Reason of the sword.

[2] (P15.S1)
Chapter III.

[3] (P15.S2)
Take the sword in hand manfully, for it is a cross and a true weapon.

[4] (P15.S3)
Together it strengthens the valiant spirit.

[5] (P15.S4)
IF you have salt in your brain, it is necessary for you to consider here what way is taken to ascend such a ladder.

[6] (P15.S5)
The Art of the sword is but an intersection, To part the point and the strikes at the context To wage war against those who wish to oppose.

[7] (P15.S6)
From one side, they make a defense, the direct strikes from one side go, the reverse from the other face off.

[8] (P15.S7)
And the straight cut in its straightness strikes, And make sure to note this reason well, The reverse with the false takes its path.

[9] (P15.S8)
And make sure to follow then as the saying goes. Place yourself in guard with the sword in hand; if you advance or retreat, remain in the line.

[10] (P15.S9)
P Because your playing may not be in vain, From that side where you turn your face, Enter from there and do not find it strange, M Putting your sword then in pursuit Towards your companion with the tip to the face, And to wound you suddenly he dispatches.

[11] (P15.S10)
And you must be very careful, with your eye on the weapon that can harm you, taking the time and measuring, gathered.

[12] (P15.S11)
To that end, let the heart be resolved to defend, the feet and arms with good measure, if you wish to take honor in all things.

[13] (P15.S12)
And note well and understand my writing, that if the companion strikes with his sword, and seeks to cross with yours.

[14] (P15.S13)
G Uard, do not stray from the path, Go with cover and with the point to the face, Hammering at the head let the strikes go.

[15] (P15.S14)
I play with the cross and shall not be conquered.

[16] (P15.S15)
If the companion crosses wide, and you thrust, wishing not to be far from him.

[17] (P15.S16)
When his half-sword has reached you, press him, for reason demands it, and leave the wide play and confront him here.

[18] (P15.S17)
There are often times when one finds that a man does not feel he possesses good strength; therefore, here one needs skill and not words.

[19] (P15.S18)
He passes through the street with skill, With the cover of the good backhand, Quickly recovering the right.

[20] (P15.S19)
If you do not feel that you have lost your skill, leave the wide and focus on the close play: You will make the stronghold change direction.

[21] (P15.S20)
And you shall make note and understand this saying: That when you cross, you shall cross with strength, For it dulls the defect of the sword.

[22] (P15.S21)
I know that skill exerts every power, Having made the cover and quick to strike, In wide and narrow you shall bring down the force.

[23] (P15.S22)
And if you want to make him feel the point, go off the path sideways, [06r] let him feel your point in his chest.

[24] (P15.S23)
With the point high and your pommel low,  
And the arms extended, with good cover,  
Step to the weary side with a good pace,  
And if the point finds the way open,  
Passing outside, do not fear,  
For in every way you will give them the offer.

[25] (P15.S24)
If you are to hold your ground, then take your stance; If you see that you cannot do well, by wielding your sword, fulfill your duty.

[26] (P15.S25)
F A' that you always remember when passing by your enemy, or when you find him; And this that I tell you do not neglect: As you see that he moves the sword, Either truly pass over or draw back, Or turn around and make sure you find him.

[27] (P15.S26)
To know, strength, and boldness must have he who wishes to have honor in arms; if this is lacking, let him refrain from practicing.

[28] (P15.S27)
And you must have a bold heart, If the great man seems strong to you, Use the skill that gives you favor.

[29] (P15.S28)
Take care, certainly, as from death, that your play is not for courtesy with others that brings you shame.

[30] (P15.S29)
And take note well of this my saying: You know your heart, not that of your companion, [06v] Never wish to use such fantasy.

[31] (P15.S30)
If you are of great malice, you will have followed such an art.

[32] (P15.S31)
Behold the good fruit of such gain.

[33] (P15.S32)
Now note and understand this part: Whoever wishes to contend in the art with all, Will stain his papers a thousand times over, Thus he loses honor for a single failure.

[34] (P15.S33)
Such believes to be above that which is below, And this sun often encounters others; Often it is made with others' babble, Contradicting if it comes to question: It shows here to him who is learned in the art.

[35] (P15.S34)
If the tongue were to cut for reason, and made itself like the sword, it would be the death of countless people.

[36] (P15.S35)
And let it be that from your mind it does not fall, That you take with reason your defense, And justly proceed with justice.

[37] (P15.S36)
He who wishes to offend others without reason certainly damns the soul and the body, and brings shame upon his master.

[38] (P15.S37)
And you must also keep in mind To always bring honor to your master, For money does not pay for such alone.

[39] (P15.S38)
He who wishes to make himself a master of the sword and skillful, must learn and teach with diligence, always lifting from himself the sinister act.

[40] (P15.S39)
If loyalty shall be beloved by you, you may speak to princes and kings, for such an art shall be practiced by them.

[41] (P15.S40)
For they are expected to govern, and each one who maintains justice must see to the orphans and other matters.

[42] (P15.S41)
This art, in sum and the head of all good, Through arms holds under the cities And keeps all the peoples in check; It also maintains within itself such dignity, That often it lifts your heart, Driving away from you always cowardice.

[43] (P15.S42)
"Indeed, acquire then the honor and esteem, and this surpasses all other things. Always maintain yourself in the grace of your lord."

[44] (P15.S43)
If you possess the art so famous, You shall never be poor in any part.

[45] (P15.S44)
This virtue that is so glorious, If poverty will show you the cards Only once then you will see Embrace wealth through such art.

[46] (P15.S45)
Once you find yourself in such a state as a extinguished light: Do not doubt that you will soon return.

[47] (P15.S46)
To find the art, it did not seem a struggle to me, I do not speak of the old but the new, that I am pleased to have noted it.

[48] (P15.S47)
I have kept it imprisoned for proof, As I leave it, I swear to you in good faith: It gives me money and benefits me, Thus it happens to those who find themselves in virtue.
